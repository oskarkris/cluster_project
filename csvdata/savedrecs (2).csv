It is crucial to determine changes in rainfall to support efforts to adapt to climate change in highly vulnerable semi-arid areas. Trends for long-term seasonal and annual rainfall magnitude and duration were determined using Mann-Kendall (MK) and quantile regression (QR) methods. Sen's slope was used to determine the magnitude of change in rainfall. Correlation analysis was conducted to determine the influence of altitude and land-use change in rainfall trends. There were dominant non-statistically significant decreasing trends for annual, seasonal rainfall magnitude, and rainfall duration. Trends from QR at low (0.1 and 0.2) and high (0.7 and 0.9) quantiles mostly deviated from those of MK. There were weak and variable correlations of long-term rainfall trends with altitude and land-use change. Land-use change and topography may therefore not adequately explain the variations of trends. Further studies are essential to understand the interaction of environmental various factors and their influence on rainfall trends. Variations of trends will impact future water resource availability and allocation. It is important to consider the deviations when developing climate change adaptation measures and ensure improved decision-making.","[Makungo, Rachel; Mashinye, Mosedi Deseree] Univ Venda, Thohoyandou, South Africa; [Mashinye, Mosedi Deseree] Dept Water & Sanitat, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Venda,"Makungo, R (corresponding author), Univ Venda, Thohoyandou, South Africa.",rachel.makungo@univen.ac.za,,"Makungo, Rachel/0000-0003-1782-3532",National Research Foundation (NRF) [AEMD160625174151],National Research Foundation (NRF),"Part of the results of the study were generated in a Masters study funded by the National Research Foundation (NRF), grant number AEMD160625174151.",,45,1,1,2,3,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",2040-2244,2408-9354,,J WATER CLIM CHANGE,J.

Here we use evidence from landscapes which are known to be environmentally sensitive to show that geomorphological change in response to shifts in climate can be highly nonlinear. Our study sites are two mountain massifs on the western coast of Ireland. Both sites have similar geological and Pleistocene glacial histories and are similar topographically, geomorphologically and in their climate histories. We show that despite these similarities their response to late Holocene, climate change has differed. Both massifs have responded to short-term climate changes over the last 4500 years that are considered to have been uniform across the region, but these climate changes have resulted in highly differentiated and nonlinear landscape responses. We argue this reflects nonlinearity in the forcing-response processes at such scales and suggests that current approaches to modelling the response of such systems to future climate change using numerical climate models may not accurately capture the landscape response. We end by discussing some of the implications for obtaining decision-relevant predictions of landscape responses to climatic forcing and for climate change adaptation and planning, using regional climate models.","[Harrison, Stephan] Exeter Univ, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Penryn TR109EZ, England; [Mighall, Tim; Mauquoy, Dmitri; Rea, Brice; Spagnolo, Matteo] Univ Aberdeen Univ, Sch Geosci, Aberdeen AB24 3FX, Scotland; [Stainforth, David A.] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Allen, Philip] Frostburg State Univ, Dept Geog, Frostburg, MD 21532 USA; [Macklin, Mark] Univ Lincoln, Coll Sci, Sch Geog, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England; [Anderson, Edward] Stockton Riverside Coll, Harvard Ave, Durham, England; [Knight, Jasper] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Passmore, David] Univ Toronto Mississauga, Dept Geog, Mississauga, ON, Canada; [Shannon, Sarah] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England",University of Aberdeen; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University System of Maryland; Frostburg State University; University of Lincoln; University of Witwatersrand; University of Toronto; University Toronto Mississauga; University of Bristol,"Harrison, S (corresponding author), Exeter Univ, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Penryn TR109EZ, England.",stephan.harrison@exeter.ac.uk,"Knight, Jasper/F-2288-2010; Spagnolo, Matteo/G-2415-2011; Mauquoy, Dmitri/AAF-1044-2019","Knight, Jasper/0000-0003-2035-9056; Spagnolo, Matteo/0000-0002-2753-338X; ",Middlesex University PhD Studentship; Coventry University PhD Studentship; NERC,Middlesex University PhD Studentship; Coventry University PhD Studentship; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),This work was partly supported by a Middlesex University PhD Studentship to EA and a Coventry University PhD Studentship to PA.

This study explores how an individual's perception of climate change impacts may influence their support for adaptation actions. Results of a survey of the U.S. public (n = 653) indicates that individuals who believe climate change impacts are unlikely to happen or will primarily affect other people in other places are less likely to be concerned about climate change impacts and less likely to support climate adaptation. However, an individual's support for climate change adaptation measures is not influenced by their perception of when climate change impacts will occur even when taking into account concern for climate impacts. Critical for policy-makers, a belief that climate adaptation measures will not be effective attenuates the relationship between psychological distance, concern for climate change impacts, and adaptation policy measures. Our results indicate that to effectively communicate about climate change, policy-makers should emphasize that: (i) climate change impacts are occurring, (ii) that their constituents are being affected now, or will be in the future, and (iii) communicate that adaptation measures can be effective in addressing risks associated with climate change impacts.","[Singh, Ajay S.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, 195 Marstellar St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Zwickle, Adam] Michigan State Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Program, 655 Auditorium Rd, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA; [Zwickle, Adam] Michigan State Univ, Sch Criminal Justice, 655 Auditorium Rd, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA; [Bruskotter, Jeremy T.; Wilson, Robyn] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 210 Kottman Hall,2021 Coffey Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Michigan State University; Michigan State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Singh, AS (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, 195 Marstellar St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",singh364@purdue.edu; zwicklea@msu.edu; bruskotter.9@osu.edu; Wilson.1376@osu.edu,"Zwickle, Adam/P-5893-2016; Bruskotter, Jeremy T/B-3240-2012","Zwickle, Adam/0000-0001-7113-993X; Bruskotter, Jeremy T/0000-0002-1782-7835; Singh, Ajay/0000-0002-5576-8178",,,,,51,74,75,18,103,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Here, we emphasize their major role in the co-design of tailored coastal climate services (CCS) based on a case study of French Polynesia. In this perspective, we assessed climate change perceptions by public authorities and identified their needs with regard to climate-related science. This assessment included an analysis of the decision-making context, semi-structured interviews with practitioners representing 23 administrative divisions directly or indirectly involved in climate change issues, and a workshop dedicated to discussing needs in terms of CCS. Generally, respondents did not identify climate change as a major current issue in French Polynesia; they showed more concern for economic growth, pollution, land tenure, and land use planning. However, interviewees were concerned about future impacts of sea-level rise (SLR) and ocean warming and acidification, mentioning in particular their detrimental impacts on marine ecosystems, shoreline position, economy (especially agriculture and the blue economy), and freshwater resources. The interviewed practitioners showed particular interest in SLR projections for future decades up to a century, and for knowledge on expected impacts to critical infrastructure, coastal systems, and natural resources. Practitioners' needs made it possible to co-define four CCS to be developed: (1) the design of sea-levelrise-compatible critical infrastructures (airports and ports); (2) adapting to the risk of destabilization of beaches and reef islands; (3) professional training on climate change impacts and adaptation, including an analysis of potentially emerging new jobs in the SLR context; and (4) the development of participatory approaches for observing climate change impacts. While the co-development of these CCS will require a multiyear engagement of stakeholders concerned with climate change adaptation, our results already shed light on specific needs for salient CCS in highly vulnerable tropical island territories.","[Terorotua, Heitea; Ouriqua, Jehane] Creocean, La Rochelle, France; [Terorotua, Heitea; Duvat, Virginie K.

While tasks are divided up between government ministries and departments in Vietnam, there is little collaboration on issues that span mandates. Similarly, while water flows in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta take resource management and health concerns across provincial boundaries, formal mechanisms for interprovincial collaboration are lacking. While decentralization efforts have sought to devolve authority and decision making to lower levels, there is continued state-centered top-down policy making, and this limits collaborative coordination across scales. All three of these issues inhibit health sector adaptation to climate change in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, and though these coordination issues are recognized by the Vietnamese government, to date there has been little success in addressing them. The authors hope to stimulate further debate and discussion of coordination problems, and conclude that despite some significant challenges, the South West Steering Committee could play a facilitating role coordinating climate change responses in health and other sectors across the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. As an analysis of governance, this research is applicable to other areas and sectors in Vietnam, as well as to other parts of South East Asia.","[Gilfillan, Daniel] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Nguyen, Thu T.] Vietnam Natl Univ Forestry, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Pham, Ha T.] Univ Econ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Australian National University; Vietnam National University of Agriculture (VNUA); Ho Chi Minh City University Economics,"Gilfillan, D (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,,"Nguyen, Thu T/0000-0002-4301-4467; Pham, Ha/0000-0003-3266-1789",Fenner School of Environment and Society at The Australian National University; Rotary Club of Hall,Fenner School of Environment and Society at The Australian National University; Rotary Club of Hall,"The authors acknowledge: The Fenner School of Environment and Society at The Australian National University and the Rotary Club of Hall for financial and material support to undertake fieldwork; the interviewees for their time and willingness to talk; A/Prof Jamie Pittock, Prof Lorraine Elliott, Adj Prof Howard Bamsey, and the reviewers for their constructive feedback on earlier drafts.

It draws on two types of fieldwork data, quantitative and qualitative, including a round of household socio-economic survey questionnaire and qualitative semi-structured interviews. We show that climate-change adaptation is class specific and varies considerably amongst the different classes within the relations of production even in the same village. The local class structure shape ownership and access to natural resources, with implications for both individual adaptive capacities and attempts to organize adaptation practices at the community-level. Specifically, adaptive practice is revealed as being largely contingent on the size of land owned and livelihood options that affects, in turn, households' adaptation capacities and their experiences of climate change. We find that whilst the village inhabitants have initiated various adaptation strategies privately, no community-based adaptation practices could be identified. As such, we call for a more comprehensive understanding of the class nature of climate change for developing effective climate adaptation strategies at the village-community level and especially for community-based adaptation (CBA) models.","[Aslany, Maryam] Univ Oxford, Wolfson Coll, Oxford OX2 6UD, England; [Brincat, Shannon] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Social Sci, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia",University of Oxford; University of the Sunshine Coast,"Aslany, M (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Wolfson Coll, Oxford OX2 6UD, England.",maryam.aslany@wolfson.ox.ac.uk,,"Brincat, Shannon/0000-0002-1426-5793",,,,,53,6,6,5,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0968-0802,1099-1719,,SUSTAIN DEV,Sustain.

In this paper we show that these comparative studies suffer from what is known as the dependent variable problem' - the indistinctness of the phenomenon that is being measured, and disagreement on its scope and boundaries. This problem has been signaled in other scientific fields where it proved to hamper meaningful comparisons and policy evaluations, transnational learning, and policy transfer. This paper aims to raise consciousness of the dependent variable problem in comparative studies on climate change adaptation policy by exploring its origins and proposes ways to deal with it. Three main sources of the problem are discussed: (1) conceptual indistinctness of adaptation policy and the heterogeneity and lack of consistency of what is being compared between cases. (2) Inadequate research designs to compare cases. (3) Unclear indicators and explanatory variables to compare across cases. We propose a way to operationalize the concept of adaptation policy, provide a narrower description of the research designs for policy change or outcomes analysis, and finally discuss possible measurements concepts.

Building on ideas of policy experimentation at the nexus of institutional and transition theories, this paper assesses six climate change adaptation experiments across the cities of Surat, Indore and Bhubaneswar in India to uncover the politics behind how experiments are conceived of, implemented, and supported in light of local development needs. Through employing both embedded and cross-case comparative methods, I argue that policy experiments are often framed around achieving tangible urban economic benefits and maximizing specific project complementarities, which allow emerging adaptation priorities access to established policy directives and funding streams. However, I conclude that despite being arenas for testing new ideas, quantifying climate and development co-benefits, and engaging private and civil society actors, adaptation policy experiments must be coherent with urban political economic contexts in order for them to affect sustained, equitable and transformative programmatic change.

To this end, the study measures the impact of such adaptations on food production using farm-level survey data from Nepal. We utilize a matching technique and stochastic production frontier model to examine the productivity and efficiency of farmers. Results reveal that the group of farmers adopting adaptations exhibit higher levels of productivity and technical efficiency in food production as compared to the non-adopters. It is evident from the results that policy makers should encourage farming households in climate change adaptations, which have the potential to enhance farmers' productivity and efficiency in agriculture, thereby contributing to two of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of eradicating hunger and poverty (SDG's target indicators 2.3).

However, the role of adaptive techniques used by farming households to reduce these negative effects and, as a result, their food insecurity status has not been sufficiently evaluated. This study explores the factors that influence smallholder farmers' adoption of climate change adaptation measures, as well as their impact on household food security. Using an endogenous treatment-effect ordered probit model, agricultural households' food security status is likely to significantly improve when they employ measures to adapt to adverse climatic conditions. The empirical findings also show that the gender makeup of the household, age, tropical livestock unit, and access to climatic information improve the likelihood of smallholder farmers adopting climate change adaptation measures. Based on the findings, this study advocates that governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) support smallholder farmers' Indigenous adaptation options with various institutional, regulatory, and technological assistance, with a particular emphasis on female-headed households.","[Ogundeji, Abiodun A.] Univ Free State, Disaster Management Training & Educ Ctr Africa, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of the Free State,"Ogundeji, AA (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Disaster Management Training & Educ Ctr Africa, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa.",ogundejiaa@ufs.ac.za,,"Ogundeji, Abiodun Akintunde/0000-0001-7356-5668",,,,,63,4,4,2,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,MAY,2022,12,5,,,,,,,589,10.3390/agriculture12050589,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12050589,,,16,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,1S9CL,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000804340200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent scholarship has reconciled common perceptions of transdisciplinary knowledge within the literature; however, little is known about how practitioners define transdisciplinary knowledge, and whether this type of knowledge production is favored. Using the Q-methodology, this study examines the role of transdisciplinary knowledge among 22 practitioners from non-governmental organizations working on climate change adaptation projects in Bolivia and Colombia.

Since >60 % of the Brazilian people live within the Atlantic forest domain, societies both in rural and urban areas are also highly vulnerable to climate change. This review examines the vulnerabilities of biodiversity and society in the Atlantic forest to climate change, as well as impacts of land use and climate change, particularly on recent biological evidence of strong synergies and feedback between them. We then discuss the crucial role ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change might play in increasing the resilience of local society to future climate scenarios and provide some ongoing examples of good adaptive practices, especially related to ecosystem restoration and conservation incentive schemes such as payment for ecosystem services. Finally, we list a set of arguments about why we trust that the Atlantic forest can turn from a shrinking biodiversity hotspot'' to a climate adaptation hope spot'' whereby society's vulnerability to climate change is reduced by protecting and restoring nature and improving human life standards.","[Scarano, Fabio Rubio] Fundacao Brasileira Desenvolvimento Sustentavel, BR-20070022 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Scarano, Fabio Rubio] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, IB, CCS, BR-21941590 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Ceotto, Paula] Conservat Int, BR-20040006 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Scarano, FR (corresponding author), Fundacao Brasileira Desenvolvimento Sustentavel, Rua Engenheiro Alvaro Niemeyer 76, BR-20070022 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",fscarano@fbds.org.br,"Scarano, Fabio Rubio/F-6620-2012","Scarano, Fabio Rubio/0000-0003-3355-9882",,,,,86,165,175,8,138,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,1572-9710,,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

It illustrates the seesawing changes between ICZM and the general planning policy and statutory framework to accommodate the political struggle of incorporating key climate change adaptation measures in sought after and economically important coastal areas. The result of this process is mixed. It could be best described as an almost total integration of ICZM into, rather than with, other legislation; and this has been accompanied by an ever-diminishing political focus on coastal management in favour of mostly project specific, generic risk and hazard assessment processes. This leaves local authorities with an even greater need of reliable and yet affordable scientific and legal tools, to effectively deal with these risks. The broader implication of the Queensland ICZM history certainly raises the question about the extent of integration that is desirable for coastal zone management, notably in conjunction with the ongoing debate about climate change adaptation. Although the State government has recently introduced a new climate change adaptation strategy and is financially supporting coastal local government in developing long-term adaptation plans, the concept of ICZM in Queensland should be revisited. In other words, there is still a need for practical approaches of implementing ICZM into existing regulatory planning, pollution control, natural resource management and biodiversity conservation frameworks.","[Warnken, Jan] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Australian Rivers Inst, Griffith, Qld, Australia; [Mosadeghi, Razieh] Griffith Ctr Coastal Management, Room 2-01,Bldg G51,Gold Coast Campus, Griffith, NSW 4222, Australia; [Warnken, Jan] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Sci 1 G24 3-24,Gold Coast Campus, Griffith, Qld 4222, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University,"Mosadeghi, R (corresponding author), Griffith Ctr Coastal Management, Room 2-01,Bldg G51,Gold Coast Campus, Griffith, NSW 4222, Australia.",j.warnken@griffith.edu.au; razieh.mosadeghi@griffithuni.edu.au,,,,,,,51,11,12,4,40,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

Therefore, the crop planting date, a low-cost agricultural management strategy aiming to alleviate crop water stress can contribute to enhance agricultural decision-making, particularly as a climate change adaptation strategy. By considering the crop water requirements throughout the crop growing cycle using a process-based crop model in conjunction with a fuzzy rule-based planting date approach, location-specific planting rules were derived for maize cropping in Burkina Faso (BF). Then, they were applied to regional future climate projections to derive optimized planting dates (OPDs) for the 2020s(2011-2030) and the 2040s (2031-2050), respectively. Based on potential maize yield simulations driven by climate change projections and planting dates, the OPD approach was compared with a well-established planting date method for West Africa and evaluated as a potential adaptation strategy for climate change. On average, the OPD approach achieved approximately +15% higher potential maize yield regardless of the regional climate model (RCM) and the period. However, the potential yield surpluses strongly decreased from the North to the South. Regarding climate change adaptation, the combined impact of climate change and the OPD approach has shown on average, a mean maize yield deviation between -23% and 34% in comparison to the 1989-2008 baseline period. Yield deviation is found to depend strongly on the RCM and location. The RCM ensemble mean yield for the period 2011-2050 revealed a maximum decrease of 8% compared to the baseline period. On the one hand, these findings highlight the potential of the OPDs as a crop management strategy but, on the other hand, it is apparent that farmers need to combine the OPDs with others suited farming practices to adequately respond to climate change.

Scholarly interest has shifted from gendered dynamics of climate change adaptation to the socio-political drivers of gendered inequalities that produce discriminatory opportunities for adaptation. This study utilises an intersectional subjectivities lens to examine how entrenched power dynamics and social norms related to gender, as well as age and marital status, galvanise or inhibit capacities to adapt in farming communities of Ghana's Central Region. Through the use of interviews, focus group discussions, and photovoice sessions, we highlight gendered and intersectional subjectivities, roles, and responsibilities that centre on perceived differences in men's and women's strength and power. We then link resulting normative performances of gender to specific barriers to adaptation, such as lack of resources and agency, and demonstrate a pronounced dichotomy as women experience the brunt of these barriers and a persistent power imbalance that positions them as 'less able' to adapt than men. Such nuanced assessments of intersectional subjectivities are instrumental in supporting marginalised groups when deliberating and renegotiating inequitable power relations in climate change adaptation. Through repeated efforts at power subversion, emboldened social actors and critical scholars attuned to navigating power differentials can strengthen adaptive capacities and facilitate trajectories toward transformation.","[Garcia, Alicea; Tschakert, Petra] Univ Western Australia UWA, Fac Arts Business Law & Educ, Dept Geog & Planning, 35 Stirling Hwy, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Karikari, Nana Afia] Univ Cape Coast UCC, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Cape Coast, Ghana",University of Western Australia,"Garcia, A (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia UWA, Fac Arts Business Law & Educ, Dept Geog & Planning, 35 Stirling Hwy, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",alicea.garcia@research.uwa.edu.au,,"Tschakert, Petra/0000-0002-4268-3378; Karikari, Nana Afia/0000-0001-6757-1498; Garcia, Alicea/0000-0002-1980-264X",Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship; University of Western Australia,"Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); University of Western Australia",This work was supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship and The University of Western Australia.,,60,6,6,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-369X,1360-0524,,GENDER PLACE CULT,Gend.

Infrastructures are largely designed as fail-safe; that is, they are not intended to fail, and when failure happens, the consequences are severe. Safe-to-fail has been recently presented as the antithesis of fail-safe, without any specific guidance of what the paradigm is or how to apply it. There is an emerging need for stakeholders, including policy makers, planners, engineers, utilities, and communities to understand infrastructure failures, bring their knowledge into the infrastructure development process, and help adapt cities to unpredictable and changing climate risks. We frame safe-to-fail as an infrastructure development paradigm that internalizes the consequences of infrastructure failure in the development process. This framing of safe-to-fail further reveals an emerging infrastructure trolley problem where the adaptive capacity of some regions is improved at the expense of others. We demonstrate practical dilemmas in developing infrastructure under nonstationary climate and guide managing trade-offs in the prioritization of different consequences of infrastructure failure.","[Kim, Yeowon] Arizona State Univ, Global Inst Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Chester, Mikhail V.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainable Engn & Built Environm, Tempe, AZ USA; [Eisenberg, Daniel A.] Naval Postgrad Sch, Operat Res Dept, Monterey, CA USA; [Redman, Charles L.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Postgraduate School; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Kim, Y (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Global Inst Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",yeowon.kim@asu.edu,"Eisenberg, Daniel/R-7488-2019","Eisenberg, Daniel/0000-0003-2514-8258; Redman, Charles/0000-0001-7193-7368; Chester, Mikhail/0000-0002-9354-2102",National Science Foundation [1444755],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported by National Science Foundation Cooperative Agreement 1444755, the Urban Resilience to Extremes Sustainability Research Network.",,76,23,23,2,8,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",,2328-4277,,EARTHS FUTURE,Earth Future,JUL,2019,7,7,,,,,704,717,,10.1029/2019EF001208,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019EF001208,,,14,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,IO3KV,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000479280100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The conceptualization of adaptation within the government system matters for the promotion of activities such as employment generation for local communities. The lesser the gap between government policy and the local community's needs for adaptation the more effective outcomes are for ensuring policy success and promoting sustainable community livelihoods or vice versa. This interface between policy and community is important for climate change adaptation which is explored in this paper along with the findings of the research project, DEltas, vulnerability and climate change: Migration and Adaptation (DECCMA) conducted during 2014-2018 in Bangladesh, Ghana, India, and the United Kingdom. The data from Bangladesh was collected from 1384 survey respondents, 19 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), 3 workshops, and 43 Key Informant Interviews (KIIs). The findings of the paper show that government adaptation activities mainly reflect the Reactive Approach of Limited Action (RALA) perspective rather than the Proactive Approach To Adaptation (PATA). The RALA perspective is characterized by piecemeal and top-down approaches to adaptation which fail to recognize a community conceptualization of climate change, policy perspectives for coping with local concerns, and governance approaches for effective adaptation. In response, the government needs to focus on the PATA in policy, programs, and projects with the governance approach implemented from the bottom-up or, in other words, from the local perspective. Community participation in decision-making processes is characteristic of this bottom-up governance model. Local community participation, consultation, and representation are essential parts of PATA in adaptation policy formulation and execution, providing important lessons for Bangladesh.","[Netherton, Corinna] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Hossen, M.

The study aims to clarify farmers' intentions and decisions regarding global climate change adaptation. Logistic regression models were used to examine the influences of socioeconomic factors and climate adaptation communication processes on farmers' decision to apply adaptation strategies against drought and flood. Specifically, for a thorough understanding of non-adapting farmers, the theory of planned behavior was incorporated, to assess these farmers' intention to adaptation. Results showed that farmers' perceptions were consistent with the weather data over a short period, reporting a rise in temperature and a greater decrease in precipitation. Agricultural experience, farm income, training, social capital, and effective climate adaptation communication were statistically significant in increasing the probability of farmers' adaptation. For farmers who do not perceive climate change but adapted nonetheless, social capital played a major factor, driving their belief in, and behavior to adaptation, of which the most important aspects were neighbors and peer groups. Farmers' intention to adapt was mostly affected by perceived behavioral control factors, followed by attitude and subjective norms. Therefore, successful policies to enhance farmers' perceptions and adaptive capacity can encourage both actual and intended adaptation farmers. Adaptation strategies require the participation of multiple players from all related sectors engaging with local communities and farmers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose was to establish whether adequate attention is given to the issue of climate change mitigation as major challenge in the world during the 21st century. Design/methodology/approach - The research design is based on qualitative research involving a review of ETA reports approved by the national environmental authority and also based on key informant consultations with licensed ETA experts in the country. Thereafter, the findings were analyzed through standard statistical procedures. Findings - The findings showed that climate change integration in all the reviewed ETA reports was mainly restricted to mere consideration of historical climate change information in the project areas and totally weak in terms of climate change prediction scenarios and their likely impacts on the proposed development projects. However, consultations with most ETA practitioners indicated that integration of climate change adaptive capabilities into the ETA process was a relevant issue but admitted that the implementation modalities were unclear. Originality/value - The study is the first in evaluating the level of integration for climate change in ETA studies in Kenya and the findings will inform ETA implementation in the country. It also forms a good basis for comparative studies with ETA studies in other countries of the world.","[Kamau, Julius W.] Embassy Sweden, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mwaura, Francis] Univ Nairobi, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Nairobi,"Kamau, JW (corresponding author), Embassy Sweden, Reg Dev Cooperat Sect, Nairobi, Kenya.",jkammash@yahoo.com,,,,,,,21,12,12,1,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Using a rapid review methodology this paper evaluates existing literature (2014-2021) on climate change adaptation in relation to water (SDG6) and gender (SDG5) in urban and peri-urban contexts. By analyzing water, gender, and adaptation literature a thematic mapping of SDG5 was done on the resulting 34 documents. Despite methodological limitations - time constraints, exclusion of gender-sustainable development literature, and narrow inclusion criteria - this paper finds a paucity of research in this space during the time period under study. Most literature focuses on low- and middle-income countries, primarily Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, to the exclusion of South America. Notably, evidence demonstrating interlinkages between SDG5 and climate change adaptations in the WaSH sector and gender sensitive dissemination of disaster warnings is lacking. Adaptation strategies resulting in negative impacts on women undermine SDG5 and maladaptive behaviours related to management of domestic water supply and disaster-risks are particularly concerning in this context. Subsequently, this paper establishes the need for practical research assessing the gendered dimensions of all adaptations, including research demonstrating interlinkages between adaptations, women-specific benefits, and strengthened legislation to promote gender equality and empowerment.","[Tandon, Indrakshi] Amer Univ Dubai, Dept Int & Middle Eastern Studies, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Wallace, Corinne] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Geog, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Wallace, Corinne] Univ Saskatchewan, Planning & Global Water Futures Programme, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Caretta, Martina Angela] Lund Univ, Human Geog Dept, Lund, Sweden; [Vij, Sumit] Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, Geneva, Switzerland; [Vij, Sumit] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Irvine, Alison] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Geog & Planning, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",American University in Dubai (AUD); University of Saskatchewan; University of Saskatchewan; Lund University; University of Geneva; Wageningen University & Research; University of Saskatchewan,"Caretta, MA (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Human Geog Dept, Lund, Sweden.",martina_angela.caretta@keg.lu.se,"Vij, Sumit/AAV-6617-2021; Tandon, Indrakshi/GRO-2277-2022","Schuster Wallace, Corinne/0000-0003-0187-0326; Irvine, Alison/0000-0001-6835-2924; Tandon, Indrakshi/0000-0002-6550-9225; Caretta, Dr. Martina Angela/0000-0002-6811-304X",,,,,77,0,0,3,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Most research has focused on the barriers to climate change adaptation, and little research exists that considers the conditions under which a municipality is able to initiate the process of mainstreaming climate adaptation. Through a case study of two municipalities in the Western Cape of South Africa, this paper identifies the factors that enable action to be taken at the local government level. The presence of dedicated environmental champions is key, particularly within political leadership. Experiencing the costs of climate change often provides the strongest initial catalyst for action and is aided by the recognition that the local environment has value. Access to a knowledge base, the availability of resources, political stability and the presence of dense social networks all positively affect adaptation mainstreaming. It is these enabling factors that other government levels and stakeholders need to support with different interventions. We draw attention to two under-researched topics, the effect of political instability on municipal functioning and the effects of social network characteristics on facilitating institutional change.","[Pasquini, Lorena; Shearing, Clifford] Univ Cape Town, Ctr Criminol, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Pasquini, Lorena; Cowling, Richard M.] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Bot, ZA-6031 Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Ziervogel, Gina] Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town; Nelson Mandela University; University of Cape Town,"Pasquini, L (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Ctr Criminol, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",lorena.pasquini@gmail.com,"Ziervogel, Gina/AAG-2945-2019; Shearing, Clifford/I-2758-2017; Shearing, Clifford/S-1795-2019; Cowling, Richard/AFU-6261-2022","Ziervogel, Gina/0000-0003-4219-6809; Shearing, Clifford/0000-0002-5036-8335; Shearing, Clifford/0000-0002-5036-8335; ",,,,,41,76,76,1,61,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The proposed approach is applied to a recent stated preference study in which the residents of the Eastern Shore of Virginia answer choice questions about alternative coastal climate change adaptation plans. While the double hurdle latent class model avoids self-contradictory assumptions, estimates and tests show that, compared with an unrestricted latent class model, it achieves a significantly better statistical fit and maintains the capability to link the heterogeneity of participants' preferences to their attributes. Moreover, the double hurdle latent class model also provides important implications in how to conduct welfare analysis based on different behavioral patterns of different groups, which leads to nontrivial changes in welfare measures.

Better understanding of the vulnerability of agriculture-dependent households to climate variability requires exploration of the barriers that constrain the implementation of adaptation strategies. This paper uses case studies from northeast Ghana and a systematic literature review to assess the barriers that restrict effective implementation of climate adaptations in SSA. Results suggest that households are constrained by financial barriers, socio-cultural barriers, institutional barriers, technological barriers and a lack of information on climate change characteristics. We examine how the various barriers interact at different levels to influence the adaptation process. Findings highlight that the development of early warning systems, effective communication of climate information and an understanding of the local context within which adaptations take place, are necessary pre-requisites to enhance climate adaptations and rural livelihoods. Households need to be supported through the provision of micro-credit schemes, community empowerment and extension initiatives aimed at enhancing social networks within farming communities in order to reduce their vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change and variability.","[Antwi-Agyei, Philip; Dougill, Andrew J.; Stringer, Lindsay C.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Antwi-Agyei, Philip] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Sci, Coll Sci, Kumasi, Ghana",University of Leeds; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Antwi-Agyei, P (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",philiantwi@yahoo.com,"Antwi-Agyei, Philip/AAI-7392-2020","Antwi-Agyei, Philip/0000-0002-8599-474X; Stringer, Lindsay/0000-0003-0017-1654; Dougill, Andrew/0000-0002-3422-8228","Economic and Social Research Council Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, University of Leeds, UK; Commonwealth Scholarship; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish","Economic and Social Research Council Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, University of Leeds, UK; Commonwealth Scholarship; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","This study was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, University of Leeds, UK and by the award of a Commonwealth Scholarship with additional fieldwork support from the International Foundation for Science (IFS).",,73,65,65,1,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Climate change adaptation can have unexpected and detrimental effects, typically conceptualized as maladaptation and narrowly defined in relation to climatic hazards and climate vulnerability. We revisit this narrow framing of maladaptation using a deliberative risk analysis method in 16 focus groups across British Columbia, Canada, where forests are crucial to social, economic and environmental well-being. 2. By analysing emergent logics of support and opposition around genomics-based assisted migration as an adaptation strategy in forests, we identify four sources of potential maladaptation in this context: technical failure, opportunity cost, path dependence and the too-narrow framing of adaptation. 3. Combined, these suggest that maladaptation is also too narrowly conceptualized, reflecting an obsolete definition of adaptation as rational adjustment to climatic hazards. Rather than being a failure of adaptation, per se, we argue that maladaptation comprises climate-adaptive policies or actions that, in a broader frame, threaten the very values that decision-makers ostensibly seek to protect and enhance.","[Findlater, Kieran; Hagerman, Shannon; Kozak, Robert; Gukova, Veronika] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Findlater, Kieran] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Findlater, Kieran] Univ British Columbia, Sch Publ Policy & Global Affairs, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"Findlater, K (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",k.findlater@alumni.ubc.ca,,"Hagerman, Shannon/0000-0002-1830-6126; Findlater, Kieran/0000-0002-6818-5588",Genome Canada [241REF]; Genome British Columbia [241REF],Genome Canada(Genome Canada); Genome British Columbia,"Genome Canada, Grant/Award Number: 241REF; Genome British Columbia, Grant/Award Number: 241REF",,34,3,3,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,2575-8314,,PEOPLE NAT,People Nat.,FEB,2022,4,1,,,,,231,242,,10.1002/pan3.10278,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pan3.10278,,NOV 2021,12,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YP7YC,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000716484700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Critical adaptation scholars warn that adaptation practice largely utilizes techno-managerial and market-based approaches which can effectively disempower local communities or re-distribute vulnerabilities to the most marginalized. To foreground alternatives to mainstream conceptions of 'best practice' in climate change adaptation, this paper draws upon postdevelopment perspectives. We present a theoretical framework to articulate the diverse, locally based, everyday adaptation response of local communities to climate change. Drawing on a small island in the Philippines as a case study, we discuss how community members respond to climate change through collective action, reciprocity, and advocacy to shape their own adaptation. A range of qualitative methods including focus groups, semi-structured interviews and participant observation reveal how community members devise their own strategies to exploit openings in politics, economy, and knowledge to advance their needs and agendas. Rather than relying on business-as-usual adaptation trajectories, this paper highlights the importance of diverse, spontaneous, and locally driven initiatives in imagining new visions for how to respond to climate change in the future.","[See, Justin; McKinnon, Katharine] Univ Canberra, Ctr Sustainable Communities, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Wilmsen, Brooke] La Trobe Univ, Dept Social Inquiry, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Canberra; La Trobe University,"See, J (corresponding author), Univ Canberra, Ctr Sustainable Communities, Bruce, ACT 2617, Australia.",justin.see@canberra.edu.au,"; Wilmsen, Brooke/O-6333-2017","See, Justin/0000-0002-5934-1374; McKinnon, Katharine/0000-0003-2991-0182; Wilmsen, Brooke/0000-0002-0970-7673",La Trobe University [2018-1-HDR-0015],La Trobe University,This work was supported by La Trobe University: [Grant Number 2018-1-HDR-0015].,,68,0,0,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

This review studies how climate change could be integrated into national surgical planning in the Western Pacific region. We searched databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Global Health) for articles on climate change and surgical care. Findings were categorised using the modified World Health Organisation Health System Building Blocks Framework. 220 out of 2577 records were included. Infrastructure: Operating theatres are highly resource-intensive. Their carbon footprint could be reduced by maximising equipment longevity, improving energy efficiency, and renewable energy use. Service delivery Tele-medicine, outreaches, and avoiding desflurane could reduce emissions. Robust surgical systems are required to adapt to the increasing burden of surgically treated diseases, such as injuries from natural disasters. Finance: Climate change adaptation funds could be mobilised for surgical system strengthening. Information systems: Sustainability should be a key performance indicator for surgical systems. Workforce: Surgical providers could change clinical, institutional, and societal practices. Governance: Planning in surgical care and climate change should be aligned. Climate change mitigation is essential in the regional surgical care scale-up; surgical system strengthening is also necessary for adaptation to climate change.

After being presented with information on climate change projections, participants identified biophysical and socio-economic opportunities and challenges to adaptation. Graziers identified key opportunities as components of resilience (incremental change), and in many cases were options that they had some knowledge of either from their own region or elsewhere in the grazing industry. The major constraint to adaptation was the lack of financial capital: with low profitability of the industry and high land costs restricting their capacity to diversify and exploit economies of scale. These constraints were exacerbated by the pressure many graziers experienced from the demand for land as a result of urban expansion. While the focus of the workshop was on the impact of climate change and capacity to adapt, many of the issues raised by graziers were pressures not solely related to climate change. Adaptation needs to be considered in light of the appropriate level (resilience-transition-transformation) and spatial scale (field to region) required to tackle the issues identified. Policy needs to support good natural resource management, rural amenity, and food and fibre production close to urban population and markets in the face of urban encroachment.","[Brown, Peter R.] CSIRO Agr Flagship, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Hochman, Zvi] CSIRO Agr Flagship, Ecosci Precinct, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Bridle, Kerry L.] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Agr, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Huth, Neil I.] CSIRO Agr Flagship, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Tasmania; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Brown, PR (corresponding author), CSIRO Agr Flagship, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",Peter.Brown@csiro.au; Zvi.Hochman@csiro.au; Kerry.Bridle@utas.edu.au; Neil.Huth@csiro.au,"Hochman, Zvi/E-8993-2010; Hochman, Zvi/HKO-0101-2023; Huth, Neil I/F-7882-2010; Huth, Neil/U-3271-2019; Brown, Peter/G-2690-2010","Hochman, Zvi/0000-0002-6217-5231; Huth, Neil I/0000-0002-4197-830X; Brown, Peter/0000-0001-5894-8329",,,,,48,10,10,0,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-048X,1572-8366,,AGR HUM VALUES,Agric.

Existing studies on how governments enable and constrain the ways in which local level communities learn and build their adaptive capacity, however, generally adopt network or market-oriented types of governance. However, the most vulnerable regions to climate change impact in the world are generally governed through hierarchical policy systems. This research aims to understand how the hierarchical policy system in Vietnam creates enables and/or constrains the policy capacity of policy actors to contribute to effective climate change adaptation. We conducted interviews (n=26) with key actors at multiple levels of government. Our findings show the importance of clear legal institutions, available financing for implementing policies, and the training of governmental staff, particularly at district and commune levels where the policy capacities are generally too low to deal with climate change impacts. We conclude that any efforts to support local actors (i.e. smallholder farmers) should include investments in policy capacity to ensure uptake and upscaling of adaptation actions more broadly.","[Le Thi Hong Phuong; Wals, Arjen E.

However, public judgments about adaptation in natural resource sectors (like forestry) require that people make difficult, value-laden and uncertain trade-offs across complex social-ecological systems. The deliberative methods (e.g. focus groups and in-depth interviews) that are typically used to explore the malleability of these judgments may underestimate the level of preference malleability in broader publics by encouraging participants to rationalize their choices in relation to their own knowledge, values and beliefs, as well as those of others. Here, we use a public survey (N = 1926) from British Columbia, Canada-where forestry is economically, environmentally and culturally vital-to investigate the malleability of public preferences for genomics-based assisted migration (AM) for climate change adaptation in forests. Following an initial judgment, respondents are given new information about AM's potential implementation and impacts-simple messages similar to those that they might encounter through traditional and social media. The results show that respondents' initial judgments are surprisingly malleable, and prone to large bi-directional shifts across all message types. The magnitude of this malleability is related to the degree of the proposed intervention, the type of message, and individuals' demographic and psychographic characteristics. These results suggest that high levels of initial public support may be illusory, and that more attention should be paid to the potential for malleability, controversy and contradiction as adaptation policies are developed and implemented. Process-based arguments related to transparent, evidence-based and adaptive governance may be more influential than risk-based arguments related to climate change and economic impacts.","[Findlater, Kieran M.; St-Laurent, Guillaume Peterson; Hagerman, Shannon; Kozak, Robert] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Findlater, Kieran M.; St-Laurent, Guillaume Peterson] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Findlater, Kieran M.] Univ British Columbia, Sch Publ Policy & Global Affairs, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"Findlater, KM (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Vancouver, BC, Canada.;Findlater, KM (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, Vancouver, BC, Canada.;Findlater, KM (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Sch Publ Policy & Global Affairs, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",k.findlater@alumni.ubc.ca; guillaume.peterson@ubc.ca; shannon.hagerman@ubc.ca; rob.kozak@ubc.ca,"St-Laurent, Guillaume Peterson/AAU-3089-2020","St-Laurent, Guillaume Peterson/0000-0002-1329-0954; Findlater, Kieran/0000-0002-6818-5588",Genome Canada [241REF]; Genome BC,Genome Canada(Genome Canada); Genome BC,"We would like to thank our respondents for their time and attention, as well as Margot Spence and Kathy Hopkins at the BC Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development for their insightful feedback during development of the survey.

Livelihoods in Zimbabwe's small-scale farming areas are mostly agriculture-based and have long suffered from low levels of production. This is largely due to poor agroecological conditions and lack of agricultural investment, including income diversification projects from the central government. Recently, extreme climatic events in these areas have exacerbated food insecurity challenges, prompting many households to relocate. The findings of this study indicate that most households in the small-scale farming regions are resorting to either short- or long-term migration to areas that offer them food security. In these areas, poor households arc forced to work on large commercial farms where they are paid in maize grain or trade their products for food to support their families. This paper argues that, if properly used together with other climate change policies promoted in Zimbabwe, human mobility can be an effective climate change adaptation strategy in small-scale farming areas.","[Maganga, Trymore; Suso, Cathy Conrad] St Marys Univ, Halifax, NS, Canada",Saint Marys University - Canada,"Maganga, T (corresponding author), St Marys Univ, Halifax, NS, Canada.",trymore.maganga@smu.ca; cconrad@smu.ca,,,,,,,78,1,1,0,2,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0974-4053,0974-4061,,AFR REV-ABINGDON,Afr.

This study characterizes risk preferences among farmers in Yongqiao and determines how these risk preferences are related to their choices regarding climate change adaptation strategies. We find that most farmers in the study area were aware of climate change. They were taking measures to protect their livelihoods against perceived changes to the local climate. The risk experiment result shows that the representative subject was risk averse, and women were more risk averse than men. The relationships between farmers' risk preferences and different climate change adaptation choices were different. Farmers' risk aversion was negatively and significantly related with adaptation strategies on planting new crop varieties and adopting new technology, but it had a significantly positive effect on purchasing weather index crop insurance. The results also indicate that the level of education, farming experience, farm size, household income and perception of climate change impacts influence farmers' adaptation decisions.

Given the realities of a changing climate, more research is needed to examine how technically trained practitioners and other actors describe their work in relation to social and political factors. This article contributes to knowledge on this topic by analyzing the narratives of 62 organizational actors in coastal Louisiana. Actors include scientists, engineers, modelers, planners, project administrators, government staff, and non-profit employees working on climate adaptation and coastal risk reduction projects outlined in Louisiana's Coastal Master Plan. While scholars critique the Master Plan as overly technocratic, I show that people weave morals and values into narratives about science. However, I show how the motivations of acting boldly, morally, and urgently in the face of emergency clash with climate justice. Some individuals within these organizations do advocate for reforming or rethinking Master Plan projects to better serve coastal communities; however, these individuals also face resistance from colleagues who frame this work as secondary or outside of their organizational purview. To conclude, I argue that research connecting technical aspects of climate adaptation planning to power and social justice outcomes has the potential to bridge disciplinary divides.","[Domingue, Simone Justine] Univ Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Domingue, Simone Justine] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Geog & Environm Sustainabil, 100 East Boyd St, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Domingue, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Geog & Environm Sustainabil, 100 East Boyd St, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",simone.domingue@ou.edu,,,,,,,77,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-0245,1475-682X,,SOCIOL INQ,Sociol.

Understanding the nature of barriers to adaptation is important so as to find strategic ways of dealing with them. However, our current understanding is limited and highly fragmented across the academic community. This paper aims to bring some conceptual convergence in these debates by applying a systematic review method to assess the current state of knowledge on barriers to adaptation in the peer-reviewed literature. The review results show that: (1) Barriers to adaptation have hardly been defined in the literature and no clear indicators exist so as to identify and assess them systematically. (2) An impressive number of barriers have been reported, but the list of possible barriers is seemingly endless. (3) The most frequently reported barriers relate to the institutional and social dimensions of adaptation. (4) Barriers are identified as configurations of climate and non-climate factors and conditions that emerge from the actor, the governance system, or the system of concern. (5) Barriers are mainly studied in developed countries with a strong focus on water-related domains. (6) The majority of studies on barriers use small-n inductive case approaches while comparative studies across different contexts are limited. (7) Although interventions to overcome barriers are recommended by most studies, empirical studies on interventions are scarce. We present further conceptual clarification and a more precise definition of barriers to adaptation. We conclude that future research should go beyond asking the questions 'if' and 'which' barriers to adaptation exist and begin asking 'how' and 'why' barriers emerge.","[Biesbroek, G.

The southernmost watersheds of St. Vincent have a rugged topography that favours flash-flooding in rainy events, with great damage because the area concentrates most of the country's population and infrastructure. To deal with this problem the Government has developed studies, engineering works and a watershed management plan. Land use management is an effective way of controlling hydrological impacts; the plan divides the watersheds in three uses, nature conservation (46%), agriculture and agroforestry (24%), and urban (30%), with categories, establishing permitted, prohibited and restricted activities. The area is close to the limit of urban development; if further expansion were essential it should be done by increasing density in lower and flatter areas. Many houses, usually low-income settlements, are in flooding or landslide risk areas, which should be decolonized, changing land use. It is also necessary to avoid hillside arable crops. Adaptation to climate change through land use management is essential, although unfortunately less socially and politically appreciated than engineering works.","[Enriquez-de-Salamanca, Alvaro] UNED, DRABA ICM, Canada Nueva 13, Madrid 28200, Spain",Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED),"Enriquez-de-Salamanca, A (corresponding author), UNED, DRABA ICM, Canada Nueva 13, Madrid 28200, Spain.",aenriquez@draba.org,"Enríquez-de-Salamanca, Alvaro/P-6114-2014","Enríquez-de-Salamanca, Alvaro/0000-0002-8492-5216",,,,,52,2,3,1,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0343-2521,1572-9893,,GEOJOURNAL,GeoJournal,AUG,2019,84,4,,,,,1107,1119,,10.1007/s10708-018-9914-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-018-9914-z,,,13,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,IK3NI,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000476495300018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Escalating climate and global changes present an imminent threat to Pacific communities, particularly for food security, livelihoods, health and safety, cultural identity and biodiversity conservation. A participatory community-based climate change adaptation planning process was used to engage with communities on Rendova Island in Western Province, Solomon Islands to identify local adaptation priorities. The methodology recognized that local community members are the managers of the resources they use daily, have direct knowledge of the status of key local resources and have direct influence over ongoing resource governance. The study focused on two objectives: (1) identifying community priorities and documenting them in adaptation plans intended for local implementation, and (2) evaluating whether community adaptation priorities addressed key vulnerabilities identified independently using a semi-quantitative vulnerability assessment. The adaptation priorities identified by the communities encompassed: governance, leadership and planning; farming and livestock; sustainable livelihoods; natural resource management; and youth capacity building. The community adaptation priorities were found to address the key climate change vulnerabilities identified in the semi-quantitative assessment and also addressed additional drivers of social vulnerability and adaptive capacity. This finding reiterates the importance of fully inclusive and participatory vulnerability assessments and community-identification of adaptation priorities coupled with scientific climate projections to comprehensively assess the complexity of social-ecological systems. The climate change adaptation priorities have informed ongoing local actions and are intended to be used by communities, government and NGOs to focus local effort, funding and project development. A review of the suitability of the adaptation priorities by similar villages on neighbouring islands would determine the utility of scaling-up and applying these adaptations to other rural communities in the Solomon Islands, and possibly more widely in other Pacific communities.","[Basel, Britt] Ecothropic, Cimarron, CO 81220 USA; [Basel, Britt] Ecothrop Mexico AC, San Cristobal de las Casa, Chiapas, Mexico; [Goby, Gillian] Asia Pacific, MCC Environm, Perth, WA, Australia; [Johnson, Johanna] C2O Pacific, Port Vila, Vanuatu, Australia; [Johnson, Johanna] C2O Pacific, Cairns, Australia; [Johnson, Johanna] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia",James Cook University,"Basel, B (corresponding author), Ecothropic, Cimarron, CO 81220 USA.",brittbasel@ecothropic.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Basel, Britt/0000-0002-9507-1383",United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Pacific-American Climate Fund,United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Pacific-American Climate Fund,"This paper reports on some components of the `Integrating climate change planning into community-based adaptation to reduce vulnerability in Solomon Islands' project.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The study focussed on Thua Thien-Hue province, utilising commune meetings, key informant interviews and a survey of 302 households as data collection methods. Findings: Smallholder farmers in the study region are undertaking short-term, reactionary adaption. In particular, ethnic minority farmers are not following a full range of steps in their decision-making, instead moving from the identification of climate impacts to implementing (other farmers') actions at scale. Practical implications: Short term adaptation and reliance on other farmers suggests that bonding social capital in the study sites is favourable but development of bridging and linking social capital through a greater network of agricultural advisory services could improve farmers' perceptions of climate risk and subsequent adaptation strategies. Theoretical implications: The study adds to the literature on farmers' decision-making for climate adaptation. Specifically, it provides insight regarding extension programme design, based on data of farmers' adaptation decision-making. Originality/value: Much has been written on farmers' adaptation to climate change. This paper focuses explicitly on the steps of that decision-making for the purpose of targeting extension programmes to support sustainable development.","[Le Thi Hoa Sen] Hue Univ, Hue Univ Agr & Forestry, 102 Phung Hung Str, Hue City, Vietnam; [Bond, Jennifer] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Agr Environm & Vet Sci, Bathurst, NSW, Australia; [Ho Dac Thai Hoang] Hue Univ, Inst Resource & Environm, Hue City, Vietnam",Hue University; Charles Sturt University; Hue University,"Sen, LTH (corresponding author), Hue Univ, Hue Univ Agr & Forestry, 102 Phung Hung Str, Hue City, Vietnam.",lthsen@hueuni.edu.vn,,"Le, Thi Hoa Sen/0000-0001-5799-4331",Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) [504.05-2018.300],Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED)(National Foundation for Science & Technology Development (NAFOSTED)),This research was funded by the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) [grant number 504.05-2018.300].,,85,0,0,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1389-224X,1750-8622,,J AGRIC EDUC EXT,J.

Values and dynamics of adaptation to climate change,METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT,,,English,Article,,,,,,climate change; adaptation; social ecology; risk; values,,"This paper uses a complex systems theory framework to clarify what adaptation to climate change means in practice, which is to make targeted changes to a society's functioning in order to avoid changes happening to that which is of value to the members of that society. It is shown that the question what is to be changed and what to be preserved is not prescribed by the facts of climate change and technology, but a contingent one to be made by society. Discussing four important domains of adaptation and the respective narratives found in academia and politics, it is investigated how these decisions are formed, giving special consideration to the case of Germany. This leads to the finding that the generally defensive framings that characterizes common notions of adaptation reinforce predominant cultural paradigms and social dynamics that arguably have contributed considerably to the need for adaptation to climate change in the first place and will most likely create further need for adaptation in the future. A paradoxical tendency to accelerate predominant social dynamics in attempts to keep current states of affairs unchanged is identified. It is concluded that the concept of adaptation is a regression behind the concept of sustainability which can easily accommodate adaptation needs but avoids the identified pitfalls of adaptation by its future orientation and oft-criticized openness.","FUTURZWEI Stiftung Zukunftsfahigkeit, D-10178 Berlin, Germany",,"Wessels, S (corresponding author), FUTURZWEI Stiftung Zukunftsfahigkeit, Rosentr 18, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",wessels@futurzwei.org,,,,,,,60,2,2,0,9,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGSBUCHHANDLUNG,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER, SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0941-2948,1610-1227,,METEOROL Z,Meteorol.

While there are political, social and economic factors that impact agricultural development, this paper will not be focusing on those factors, instead focusing on the potential use of cover crops as a nutrient management tool, a soil and water conservation practice, and a good approach to adapting to a changing climate. The potential of using cover crops for climate change adaptation and mitigation will be reviewed. Cover crops are a key tool that could contribute to increased yields, conservation of surface and groundwater quality, reduced erosion potential, sequestration of atmospheric carbon (C), and improved soil quality and health across the tropics. However, there are a lot of research gaps, and there is a need for additional research about the potential use of cover crops for soil, human, and animal health, as well as a need for an open-access data information system about research on cover crops in the tropics. While cover crops show a lot of promise, they are not a silver bullet, and in some circumstances, they can also contribute to reduced yields. We evaluated the use of cover crops and we ranked the different ways that cover crops can contribute to climate change adaptation, on a scale ranging from very low potential to contribute to climate change adaptation to very high potential. For example, cover crops have very high potential to reduce erosion generated by a changing climate in humid systems. On average, cover crops appear to be a good practice for climate change adaptation and mitigation across the tropics, and nutrient managers, agronomists, and soil and water conservation practitioners could add them to their management toolbox for different regions of the tropics. The 4 Rs of cover crops should be applied when using this tool (the right cover crop, the right timing of placement, the right timing of killing, and the right management).","[Delgado, Jorge A.; Neer, Donna] USDA ARS, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Barrera Mosquera, Victor H.; Cartagena Ayala, Yamil E.; Escudero Lopez, Luis O.] Inst Nacl Invest Agropecurarias INIAP, Estn Expt Santa Catalina, Panamericana Km 1, Quito, Ecuador; [Alwang, Jeffrey R.; Villacis-Aveiga, Alexis] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Monar, Carlos] Univ Estatal Bolivar, Guaranda, Ecuador",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Delgado, JA (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA.",jorge.delgado@usda.gov,,"Villacis, Alexis/0000-0001-5423-1507",,,,,181,6,6,9,24,ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B STREET, SUITE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0065-2113,2213-6789,978-0-12-824573-6,ADV AGRON,Adv.

New policies or expectations of policy changes that impact private assets, such as housing, may generate economic incentives that result in unintended consequences. We examine the effect on new housing development resulting from a scientific report by a regulatory agency mandating coastal communities in North Carolina (NC) consider sea-level rise when developing new land-use policies. Estimates from our preferred triple-differences model suggest the policy announcement increased building permits by 32% in coastal NC counties until permitting returned to pre-policy levels after a moratorium on new regulations was passed by the state legislature. Our results are supported by numerous robustness checks, including alternative controls, placebo tests and a parcel-level model in Dare County, NC.

It is dominated by Caatinga, the world's most diverse seasonally dry forest and home to 59% of Brazilians in extreme poverty, most in rural areas under water scarcity. Land use and climate changes are expected to exacerbate socio-economic vulnerability, making it a top climate change adaptation priority. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is a mix of policies, more cost-effective when promoting adaptation. Through a systematic review, we investigated the political context percolating EbA and climate change adaptation in the Caatinga. Unlike the political history, land use policies in Caatinga should support sustainable agriculture and ecosystem conservation to promote adaptation. We discuss obstacles and opportunities for implementing EbA in the region and present a novel EbA policy-mix framework integrated with the Coexistence with the Semi-aridity paradigm. This includes contextualized education, capacity development, social technologies, well planned and climate resilient protected areas, and land title grants.","[Niemeyer, Julia] Fed Univ Rio Janeiro, Biol Inst, Ctr Ciencias Saude CCS, Av Carlos Chagas Filho 373, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Vale, Mariana M.] Fed Univ Rio Janeiro UFRJ, Dept Ecol, CP 68020, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",,"Niemeyer, J (corresponding author), Fed Univ Rio Janeiro, Biol Inst, Ctr Ciencias Saude CCS, Av Carlos Chagas Filho 373, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",julia.niemeyer@gmail.com,,,"Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) [232.356/2022, E-26/202.647/2019]; Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [142215/2019-8]; Brazilian Network on Global Climate Change Research (Rede CLIMA) (CNPq) [380924/2018-8]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [304908/2021-5]; CNPq [465610\2014-5]; FAPEG [201810267000023]; FINEP [01.13.0353-00]",Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ)(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)); Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Brazilian Network on Global Climate Change Research (Rede CLIMA) (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF)); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPEG(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Goias (FAPEG)); FINEP(Financiadora de Inovacao e Pesquisa (Finep)),"As financial support to this research, JN received a doctoral fellowship from the Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ Grant no. 232.356/2022) and from The Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq Grant no. 142215/2019-8) and a Technical Support fellowship from the Brazilian Network on Global Climate Change Research (Rede CLIMA) (CNPq Grant no. 380924/2018-8).

While transdisciplinary research processes have been a topic of reflection, practice, and refinement for some time, these trends now mean that the global change research community needs to reflect and learn how to pursue collaborative research on a large scale. This paper shares insights from a seven-year climate change adaptation research program that supports collaboration between more than 450 researchers and practitioners across four consortia and 17 countries. The experience confirms the importance of attention to careful design for transdisciplinary collaboration, but also highlights that this alone is not enough. The success of well-designed transdisciplinary research processes is also strongly influenced by relational and systemic features of collaborative relationships. Relational features include interpersonal trust, mutual respect, and leadership styles, while systemic features include legal partnership agreements, power asymmetries between partners, and institutional values and cultures. In the new arena of large-scale collaborative science efforts, enablers of transdisciplinary collaboration include dedicated project coordinators, leaders at multiple levels, and the availability of small amounts of flexible funds to enable nimble responses to opportunities and unexpected collaborations.","[Cundill, Georgina; Currie-Alder, Bruce; Khan, Ahmed; Landry, Marie-Eve] Int Dev Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1P 0B2, Canada; [Harvey, Blane] McGill Univ, Dept Integrated Studies Educ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada; [Tebboth, Mark; New, Mark] Univ East Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Cochrane, Logan] Carleton Univ, Global & Int Studies, Ottawa, ON K1P 0B2, Canada; [Vincent, Katharine] Kulima Integrated Dev Solut, ZA-3200 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Lawn, Jon; Nicholls, Robert J.] Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Scodanibbio, Lucia; New, Mark] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, ZA-8001 Cape Town, South Africa; [Prakash, Anjal; Wester, Philippus] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Leone, Michele] Int Dev Res Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya; [Morchain, Daniel; DeMaria-Kinney, Jesse] Oxfam GB, Oxford OX4 2JY, England; [Ludi, Eva] Overseas Dev Inst, London SE1 8NJ, England",McGill University; University of East Anglia; Carleton University; University of Southampton; University of Cape Town,"Cundill, G (corresponding author), Int Dev Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1P 0B2, Canada.",gkemp@idrc.ca,"New, Mark/A-7684-2008; Wester, Philippus/B-7186-2008; Currie-Alder, Bruce/Q-4071-2018; Nicholls, Robert James/G-3898-2010; Tebboth, Mark/AAK-9815-2020; Nicholls, Robert James/ABD-1481-2020; Cochrane, Logan/X-7882-2019","New, Mark/0000-0001-6082-8879; Wester, Philippus/0000-0002-0126-7853; Currie-Alder, Bruce/0000-0002-3224-4136; Nicholls, Robert James/0000-0002-9715-1109; Tebboth, Mark/0000-0003-1193-8080; Nicholls, Robert James/0000-0002-9715-1109; Cochrane, Logan/0000-0001-7321-8295; Ludi, Eva/0000-0002-9069-7598; Harvey, Blane/0000-0002-6626-4290","UK Government's Department for International Development; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada","UK Government's Department for International Development; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada(CGIAR)","This work was carried out under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA) with financial support from the UK Government's Department for International Development and the International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada.

Sanitation concerns include damage and loss of services from floods and reduced carrying capacity of waters receiving wastewater. Key actions to reduce climate risks include the integration of measures of climate resilience into water safety plans, as well as improved accounting and management of water resources. Policy prescriptions on technologies for service delivery and changes in management models offer potential to reduce risks, particularly in low-income settings. Water and sanitation services contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Choice of wastewater treatment technologies, improved pumping efficiency, use of renewable sources of energy, and within-system generation of energy offer potential for reducing emissions. Overall, greater attention and research are required to understand, plan for, and adapt to climate change in water and sanitation services.

Yet, an emerging body of work has raised critical questions about how adaptation is being conceived and implemented in the global South. We systematize and contribute to this critical scholarship by distinguishing three fundamental political dimensions of the adaptation problem, related to differential responsibility, the global uneven production of vulnerability, and unequal relations of power in adaptation decision-making itself. Further, based on research from across the global South, the paper suggests that the current program of 'mainstreaming' adaptation into existing development logics and structures perpetuates an anti politics machine, obscuring and depoliticizing rather than addressing the political dimensions of the adaptation problem. Mainstreaming risks not only reproducing development-as-usual, but in fact reinforcing technocratic patterns of control. The three-dimensional view of the politics of climate change adaptation is offered as an analytical perspective to sharpen and systematize future critical adaptation scholarship. In the conclusion, we highlight avenues toward enhanced attention to power and justice in climate change research and practice. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The challenges that devolution can address include bureaucratic inefficiencies, poor accountability and transparency, unequal distribution of resources, low citizen engagement, increased poverty and marginalization. The need for devolution in the context of disaster risk reduction (DRR) is even more critical owing to the fact that it has potential to improve governance which can influence the meaningful engagement of communities at-risk in planning. This paper adopts a diagnostic approach on investigating the extent devolution is augmenting DRR as well as adaptation to climate change adaptation (CCA) in five arid counties in Kenya over the 2014-2018 period. The analysis shows that county DRR policy frameworks are at various stages of development, DRR is increasingly being institutionalized and it has been integrated into County Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs). A number of challenges noted in the implementation of DRR include inadequate funds, weak coordination mechanisms, few and poorly trained personnel, insufficient engagement of the vulnerable persons and low commitment from county policy makers. The policies being developed were also found to be poorly aligned to the national and Sendai framework while the DRR and CCA responsible institutions operate asymmetrically. The study recommends greater commitment in mainstreaming DRR and adaptation into entire county planning processes and capacitating the institutions to support risk - informed planning. Systems for engaging the most vulnerable persons need to be developed and applied to ensure their voice is heard in development planning processes.","[Nyandiko, Nicodemus Omoyo] Masinde Muliro Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Disaster Management & Sustainable Dev, Kakamega, Kenya",,"Nyandiko, NO (corresponding author), Masinde Muliro Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Disaster Management & Sustainable Dev, Kakamega, Kenya.",nnyandiko@mmust.ac.ke,,,USAID's Agile Harmonized Assistance for Devolved Institutions under the State University of New York (SUNY) Research Foundation funds,USAID's Agile Harmonized Assistance for Devolved Institutions under the State University of New York (SUNY) Research Foundation funds,"We are grateful to Edmond Were, Thabo and China Samuel for their insightful inputs.

Climate change is a complex problem that requires traditional disciplines to work together to facilitate an integrated and coordinated response to its impacts. Transdisciplinary research approaches have been recognised for being well placed to aid responses to complex problems such as climate change. This paper draws on the experience of the South East Queensland Climate Adaptation Research Initiative (SEQCARI), Australia, to reflect upon the challenges involved in undertaking transdisciplinary research aimed at developing and improving a range of adaptation options for specific sectors as well as across sectors. Challenges and learning's are discussed based on the three phases of transdisciplinary research processes: problem framing and team building, co-creation of solution-oriented transferable knowledge, and (re)integration and application of created knowledge. Four key insights are then discussed to advance transdisciplinary research approaches for climate change adaptation: adoption of a dynamic learning approach such as learning-by-doing/ doing-by-learning to provide sufficient flexibility and scope to navigate potential barriers and conflicts; selection of social sciences to drive integration; choice of one sector as a platform for integration; and acknowledgement of existing barriers and limitations associated with the political context in which the research takes place.

Some of these relate to the nature and quality of vulnerability assessments, while others concern how well assessments link with adaptation actions. By highlighting four persistent assumptions about the role of vulnerability assessments in adaptation, this paper seeks to identify ways in which the practice of vulnerability assessment can better support progressive adaptation actions. This paper argues that, for adaptation actions identified within vulnerability assessments to be successful, there is a need for assessment to: (i) engage with marginalized perspectives; (ii) draw upon diverse knowledge domains; (iii) integrate scales of analysis with appropriate scales of action; and (iv) build political will. This requires vulnerability assessment to be considered as more than just a method for information generation on who is most vulnerable to climate change, where they are located and the underlying reasons for their vulnerability. In addition, improving the rigor and transparency of assessments and engagement with stakeholders during the assessment process can better facilitate vulnerability-focused adaptation.","[Miller, Fiona] Macquarie Univ, Dept Environm & Geog, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Bowen, Kathryn] Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Macquarie University; Australian National University,"Miller, F (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Environm & Geog, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",fiona.miller@mq.edu.au,,"Bowen, Kathryn/0000-0002-2125-1963; Miller, Fiona/0000-0003-4427-6466",AusAID Australian Development Research Award [49834]; University of Melbourne Future Generation Fellowship,AusAID Australian Development Research Award; University of Melbourne Future Generation Fellowship,The research underpinning this paper was partly funded by an AusAID Australian Development Research Award (ref. no. 49834) and supported by a University of Melbourne Future Generation Fellowship formerly held by Fiona Miller.,,72,20,20,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-5517,1471-5465,,IMPACT ASSESS PROJ A,Impact Assess.

However, setting goals to adapt is wrought with several challenges. This paper discusses two sets of challenges to goals of anticipatory adaptation, of (1) empirical and (2) normative character. The first set of challenges concern issues such as the extent to which the climate will change, the local impacts of such changes, and available adaptive responses. In the second set of uncertainties are issues such as the distribution of burdens to enhance adaptive capacities in vulnerable agents with a legitimate claim to such resources, and what anticipatory adaptation ideally should result in. While previous discussions have been limited to either discuss the first or second set of uncertainties, this paper suggests that both dimensions should be considered when setting goals in social planning with long time frames. A taxonomy will be suggested that combines both dimensions. Furthermore, strategies for managing situations in which there are either empirical, or normative, uncertainties will be proposed which could be used in social decision-making with long planning time-frames in which goals must be set.","Royal Inst Technol, Div Philosophy, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Baard, P (corresponding author), Royal Inst Technol, Div Philosophy, Brinellvagen 32, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",patrik.baard@abe.kth.se,,"Baard, Patrik/0000-0003-2835-919X",,,,,42,0,0,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1187-7863,1573-322X,,J AGR ENVIRON ETHIC,J.

Actually, the multi-hazard nature of CC and the inherent uncertainties it still holds force planners not to underestimate the planning and implementation of adaptation measures, with the aim of avoiding inefficiencies or even maladaptation. Therefore, this research focuses on adaptation services and disservices, with the latter still an unexplored field, of the ecosystem-based or nature-based measures with the aim of eliminating the naive narrative with which they are often proposed in urban planning processes.

By constructing and operationalising an analytical framework capable of tracing the level of mainstreaming throughout different phases of the policy cycle, we provide an answer to the question 'what works and what doesn't' in the integration of climate change in development cooperation. We combine a document analysis with semi-structured expert interviews, encompassing both HQ level in Brussels as well as EU aid activities in nine different developing countries. Our findings indicate that the Commission envisions a harmonisation approach towards CCA mainstreaming, targeting aid activities related to sustainable agriculture, food security and rural development. Although the toolbox for mainstreaming allows for a prioritisation of CCA, the procedural approach is currently ineffective due to limited staff and mainstreaming fatigue. In contrast, the growing political salience of CCA mainstreaming can be considered the main driver of mainstreaming efforts in the Commission.","[De Roeck, Frederik; Orbie, Jan; Delputte, Sarah] Univ Ghent, Ctr EU Studies, Univ Str 8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Orbie, Jan; Delputte, Sarah] Univ Ghent, Dept Polit Sci, Univ Str 8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University,"De Roeck, F (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Ctr EU Studies, Univ Str 8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Frederik.Deroeck@Ugent.be; Jan.Orbie@Ugent.be; Sarah.Delputte@Ugent.be,"De Roeck, Frederik/AAD-3436-2020","De Roeck, Frederik/0000-0003-1030-2224",Research Foundation Flanders [11ZU217N],Research Foundation Flanders(FWO),This work was supported by the Research Foundation Flanders [grant number 11ZU217N].,,29,22,22,1,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

The present study is among the pioneering studies considering dairy sector in developing countries in general and Pakistan in particular. A well-structured questionnaire was used to interview 450 dairy households from three agro-ecological zones of Punjab province of Pakistan. The study employed binary logit models to determine the influence of climate risk perception, risk attitude and other factors on adaptation decision of farmers. The findings of study revealed that climatic risk perception and risk tolerant nature of farmers positively influenced the use of adaptation measures such as selling of weak/diseased animals, migration, offfarm income activities and changes in cropping pattern, while risk averse behavior had negative impact on adaptation decisions. Among other determinants, education, farming experience, number of dairy animals, access to extension/veterinary officer and access to credit facilities has positive and significant influence on adaptation to climate change. Study also identified major constraints (socio-psychological, economic, technical, infrastructural/institutional and communicational) preventing dairy farmers to adopt adaptation measures against climatic risks.

Then this article operationalizes the four legal dimensions via reviewing current Vietnamese climate adaptation laws and policies to assess to what extent they promote a climate-resilient Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD).

The dataset comprises farmers' responses on the likely determinants of adaptation decisions, actual uptake of adaptation measures, and the barriers to adaptation. We collected the data by conducting face-to-face interviews of 327 farmers using structured questionnaires in all nine districts representing the Mountain, Hill, and Terai agroecosystems in the province. We employed a stratified random sampling technique to recruit participants and interviewed them during December 2019 and March 2020. The interview methodology was approved by the Human Ethics Review Committee at Deakin University, Australia.

However, climate change policy is often formulated without significant input from science. We examine whether the availability and accessibility of information related to climate change is a major barrier for policy action on climate change adaptation for smallholder farmers. We also investigate whether scientific information related to climate change is available and used in policy making in Central America and Mexico. Our online survey of 105 decision makers indicated that a lack of scientific and technical information hinders policy makers from developing policies to help smallholder farmers adapt to climate change. Specific needs include information on the impacts of climate change on water availability for agriculture and the areas that are or will be prone to flooding, droughts or landslides. Information about the location of the farmers who are most vulnerable to climate change, the projected temperature and precipitation in agricultural areas and the expected impacts of climate change on crop yields or animal productivity, is also needed. Despite high interest in having scientific information guide policy making, many respondents indicated that policy makers rarely use this information in adaptation planning. In addition to ensuring that relevant information is available to inform policy making, technical and scientific information must be published in venues that are readily accessible for policy makers, easy to understand, and written in a format that is policy-relevant. It is also critical that scientific articles provide specific recommendations for achieving desired policy outcomes.","[Donatti, Camila I.; Harvey, Celia A.; Ruth Martinez-Rodriguez, M.] Conservat Int, Betty & Gordon Moore Ctr Sci, 2011 Crystal Dr,Suite 500, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; [Vignola, Raffaele] CATIE, Climate Change & Watershed Program, Latin Amer Chair Environm Decis Global Change CLA, Turrialba 7170, Costa Rica; [Rodriguez, Carlos Manuel] Conservat Int, Policy Ctr Environm & Peace, 2011 Crystal Dr,Suite 500, Arlington, VA 22202 USA",Conservation International; CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza; Conservation International,"Donatti, CI (corresponding author), Conservat Int, Betty & Gordon Moore Ctr Sci, 2011 Crystal Dr,Suite 500, Arlington, VA 22202 USA.",cdonatti@conservation.org; charvey@conservation.org; rmartinez@conservation.org; rvignola@catie.ac.cr; cmrodriguez@conservation.org,"Martinez-Rodriguez, M Ruth/GZK-6596-2022; Donatti, Camila I./AAV-2324-2020; Donatti, Camila/AAF-3605-2020","Martinez-Rodriguez, M Ruth/0000-0002-4690-6794; Harvey, Celia A./0000-0001-8015-703X; vignola, raffaele/0000-0003-3483-5076",Conservation International's institutional Climate Change Team within the Global Strategy Grou p,Conservation International's institutional Climate Change Team within the Global Strategy Grou p,"This study was conducted as part of the CASCADE project (Ecosystem-based Adaptation for Smallholder Subsistence and Coffee Farming Communities in Central America).

Adaptation takes place from the governance to the individual level of fishers. At the individual level, skippers make day-to-day decisions on where to fish and are at the forefront of the response to changes at sea. We seek to understand such individual adaptation in large-scale fisheries, using the case of the Spanish tropical tuna fishery. We surveyed 22% of Spanish freezer purse seine skippers operating in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. In the last 10 years, more than half of skippers used new technology to search for tunas and expanded their fishing area as adaptation actions. Using cluster analysis, we identified two skipper groups-based on stated behaviours to confront different hypothetical scenarios of catch decline-that would follow adaptation or transformation strategies. The majority of skippers would follow adaptation strategies until a hypothetical 30% catch decrease and then choices diverge. Skipper characteristics, such as importance given to intergenerational knowledge, perceptions of change in tropical tuna abundance, and years working in the current job, can explain the adaptation and transformation choices. These findings help understand the potential for adaptation behaviour by skippers involved in fisheries confronting catch declines.","[Rubio, Iratxe; Ojea, Elena] Univ Vigo, CIM, Future Oceans Lab, Vigo, Spain; [Rubio, Iratxe] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Leioa, Spain; [Hobday, Alistair J.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Hobday, Alistair J.] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas, Australia",Universidade de Vigo; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Tasmania,"Rubio, I (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, CIM, Future Oceans Lab, Vigo, Spain.;Rubio, I (corresponding author), Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Leioa, Spain.",irrubio@uvigo.es,"Hobday, Alistair/A-1460-2012","Hobday, Alistair/0000-0002-3194-8326; Rubio, Iratxe/0000-0002-7025-006X",Universidade de Vigo/CISUG,Universidade de Vigo/CISUG,Funding for open access charges was provided by the Universidade de Vigo/CISUG.,,57,3,3,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1054-3139,1095-9289,,ICES J MAR SCI,ICES J.

Seaweed farms release carbon that maybe buried in sediments or exported to the deep sea, therefore acting as a CO2 sink. The crop can also be used, in total or in part, for biofuel production, with a potential CO2 mitigation capacity, in terms of avoided emissions from fossil fuels, of about 1,500 tons CO2 km(-2) year(-1). Seaweed aquaculture can also help reduce the emissions from agriculture, by improving soil quality substituting synthetic fertilizer and when included in cattle fed, lowering methane emissions from cattle. Seaweed aquaculture contributes to climate change adaptation by damping wave energy and protecting shorelines, and by elevating pH and supplying oxygen to the waters, thereby locally reducing the effects of ocean acidification and de-oxygenation. The scope to expand seaweed aquaculture is, however, limited by the availability of suitable areas and competition for suitable areas with other uses, engineering systems capable of coping with rough conditions offshore, and increasing market demand for seaweed products, among other factors. Despite these limitations, seaweed farming practices can be optimized to maximize climate benefits, which may, if economically compensated, improve the income of seaweed farmers.","[Duarte, Carlos M.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; [Duarte, Carlos M.; Bruhn, Annette; Krause-Jensen, Dorte] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Silkeborg, Denmark; [Duarte, Carlos M.; Krause-Jensen, Dorte] Aarhus Univ, Arctic Res Ctr, Silkeborg, Denmark; [Wu, Jiaping; Xiao, Xi] Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Zhoushan, Peoples R China",King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; Aarhus University; Aarhus University; Zhejiang University,"Duarte, CM (corresponding author), King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.;Duarte, CM (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Silkeborg, Denmark.;Duarte, CM (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Arctic Res Ctr, Silkeborg, Denmark.",carlos.duarte@kaust.edu.sa,"xiao, xi/K-1027-2014; Duarte Quesada, Carlos Manuel/ABD-6208-2021; Duarte, Carlos M/A-7670-2013; Xiao, Xi/M-4661-2019; Bruhn, Annette/HMO-5011-2023; Wu, Jiaping/AAD-8800-2022","xiao, xi/0000-0002-9753-6586; Duarte, Carlos M/0000-0002-1213-1361; Xiao, Xi/0000-0002-9753-6586; ",King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST); MacroAlgae Biorefinery 4 (MAB4) project - Innovation Fund Denmark; Macrofuels project - Innovation Fund Denmark; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [654010]; COCOA project under the BONUS programme - EU 7th Framework Programme; Danish Research Council; International Science and Technology Cooperation Program of China [2015DFA01410],King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)(King Abdullah University of Science & Technology); MacroAlgae Biorefinery 4 (MAB4) project - Innovation Fund Denmark; Macrofuels project - Innovation Fund Denmark; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; COCOA project under the BONUS programme - EU 7th Framework Programme; Danish Research Council(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)); International Science and Technology Cooperation Program of China,"This research was supported by King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) through the baseline fund to CD.

As the climate system interacts with the hydrologic cycle, one significant repercussion of global warming includes changes in water availability at both regional and local scales. Climate change adaptation is intrinsically difficult to attain due to the dynamic earth system and lack of a comprehensive understanding of future climate and its associated uncertainties. Mostly in developing countries, climate adaptation is hampered by scarcity of good quality and adequate hydro-meteorological data. This article provides a synopsis of the modelling chain applied to investigate the response of the hydrologic system under changing climate, which includes choosing the appropriate global climate models, downscaling techniques, emission scenarios, and the approach to be used in hydrologic modelling. The conventional criteria for choosing a suitable hydrological model are discussed. The advancement of emission scenarios including the latest Shared Socioeconomic Pathways and their role in climate modelling, impact assessment, and adaptation, are also highlighted. This paper also discusses the uncertainties associated with modelling the hydrological impacts of climate change and the plausible approaches for reducing such uncertainties. Among the outcomes of this review include highlights of studies on the commonly used hydrological models for assessing the impact of climate change particularly in the sub-Saharan Africa region and some specific reviews in southern Africa. Further, the reviews show that as human systems keep on dominating within the earth system in several ways, effective modelling should involve coupling earth and human systems models as these may truly represent the bidirectional feedback experienced in the modern world. The paper concludes that adequate hydro-meteorological data is key to having a robust model and effective climate adaptation measures, hence in poorly gauged basins use of artificial neural networks and satellite datasets have shown to be successful tools, including for model calibration and validation.","[Banda, Vincent Dzulani; Kanyerere, Thokozani] Univ Western Cape, Dept Earth Sci, Private Bag X17, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa; [Dzwairo, Rimuka Bloodless] Durban Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, POB 101112, ZA-3209 Midlands, Midlands, South Africa; [Dzwairo, Rimuka Bloodless] Durban Univ Technol, Inst Water & Wastewater Technol, POB 1334, ZA-4001 Durban, South Africa; [Singh, Sudhir Kumar] Univ Allahabad, K Banerjee Ctr Atmospher & Ocean Studies, Nehru Sci Ctr, Prayagraj 211002, Uttar Pradesh, India",University of the Western Cape; Durban University of Technology; Durban University of Technology; University of Allahabad,"Banda, VD (corresponding author), Univ Western Cape, Dept Earth Sci, Private Bag X17, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa.",vsdbanda@gmail.com,"singh, sudhir/HNS-9950-2023; Dzwairo, Bloodless Rimuka/AFS-8550-2022","singh, sudhir/0000-0001-5267-665X; Dzwairo, Bloodless Rimuka/0000-0002-0127-2978; Singh, Sudhir Kumar/0000-0001-8465-0649; Kanyerere, Thokozani/0000-0002-1906-7155",South Africa National Research Foundation (NRF); grant BRICS multilateral RD project [BRICS2017-144]; NRF UID [116021]; Durban University of Technology UCDG Water Research Focus Area grant; University of the Western Cape under the Research Incentive Funds,South Africa National Research Foundation (NRF)(National Research Foundation - South Africa); grant BRICS multilateral RD project; NRF UID; Durban University of Technology UCDG Water Research Focus Area grant; University of the Western Cape under the Research Incentive Funds,"The financial assistance of the South Africa National Research Foundation (NRF) is hereby acknowledged.

In climate adaptation and natural resource management literature, this structural component is often related to social capital, which is defined in various ways but usually refers to a public good that is built and fostered within a network of social relations. While hypotheses about social capital in networks are well studied in network literature, here, I argue that they should be reflected and tested in the particular context of climate change adaptation policy. I ask: how do communities affected by climate change and the broad range of actors involved in the design of climate adaptation policies build social relationships? And, how do they manage to maintain those relations over time? To answer these questions, climate adaptation policies in six Swiss mountain regions are investigated via social network analysis. Hypotheses about the creation and preservation of weak versus strong ties under the particular setting of Swiss federalism and climate-affected local communities are tested. Results confirm that the creation of weak ties, such as one-way information transfer, can lead to the establishment of mutual collaboration relations over time. Such mutual and reciprocal relations can then more easily be activated by local communities to produce both short-term responses and long-term solutions to climate change impacts.

It undertakes a systematic quantitative review of the literature dealing with the core themes of climate change awareness, knowledge, and engagement in policy-making. The findings reveal a gap in the existing academic literature on public engagement, its impacts on different types of knowledge, and the integration of both into climate change adaptation policy. In addition, findings show a strong link between public knowledge and engagement that can be used to encourage and motivate the public by using behavioural economics as a policy instrument.

In the context of climate change, challenges arise from the potential limitations of water availability and resulting conflicts within the agricultural sector. Northeast Lower Saxony is the region with the highest irrigation intensity in Germany due to the sandy soils with low water holding capacity, the cultivation of crops with high water demand, and a negative climatic water balance during the summer months. Water resources will become more limited as a consequence of climate change. Simultaneously, the irrigation demand will most likely increase due to intensified crop cultivation. Objective: Responding to these challenges, we developed a novel method to identify leverage points for effective climate change adaptation measures. We applied this method to analyze opportunities for climate change adaptation within the agricultural sector in Northeast Lower Saxony. Furthermore, we assessed the potential of stakeholders to implement adaptation measures that correspond to the identified leverage points on different time scales. Methods: Our leverage point analysis is based on a qualitative system dynamics model that was developed within a participatory modeling framework. We analyzed parameters, feedback loops, and typical system archetypes within the model. Leverage points that were related to the design and the intent of the model emerged during the iterative model building process. Subsequently, we introduced a rating system to evaluate the potential of each leverage point to be successful as a climate change adaptation measure. We provide a point-by-point analysis of the potential of key stakeholders to implement adaptation measures. Results and conclusions: The leverage points analysis was applied to the case study of Northeast Lower Saxony. It revealed that collective action is needed to cope with these challenges. Decision-makers should provide financial incentives to increase water retention in the region. Farmers will have to improve irrigation efficiency and technology for crop production. Increased societal awareness of climate change-related water shortages has the potential to direct the system towards more sustainable water use and consumption patterns. Significance: Our novel and structured approach is an attempt to analyze complex socio-economic systems.

Even such a weak starting point can justify a role for social justice in environmental decisions and governance. The article first discusses how, in the light of rational choice theories, science can contribute to environmental decision-making by improving the knowledge upon which it is premised. It then demonstrates how social justice can contribute to the legitimacy and effectiveness of environmental decisions. These arguments are then exemplified and elaborated by applying them to the core dilemmas of governing adaptation to climate change, which include capping the atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration, financing and distributing adaptation assistance to vulnerable developing countries, and planning and deciding on adaptive responses. A safe minimum standard for the maximum greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere, a universal carbon tax, and procedural templates extending participation in adaptation planning and decisions are examples of solutions that would enhance social justice in adaptation to climate change.","Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Paavola, J (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",j.paavola@see.leeds.ac.uk,"Paavola, Jouni/A-5413-2010","Paavola, Jouni/0000-0001-5720-466X",,,,,50,42,42,2,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0964-4016,,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

This paper highlights gaps between theory and practice by analyzing the justice dimensions of dilemmas routinely faced by adaptation administrators, using the example of property acquisitions to ground the analysis. Justice theories struggle to assist decision-makers in: prioritizing distribution of resources; distributing programs that cause both harms and benefits; weighing uncertain harms and benefits; identifying participants and resolving conflicts in participatory processes; and redressing historic injustices. Proposals to improve adaptation justice that do not address one or more of the practical dilemmas faced by administrators are unlikely to advance the cause. Absent theoretical or policy guidance, decisions are often shaped by administrators' unconscious heuristics such as views on the role of government and the purpose of buyouts. Tailoring justice-relevant decisions to local contexts may provide greater benefits than a universal approach to justice, but a relative approach is most likely to be just when justice-relevant decisions are transparent and informed by theoretical and empirical work. Transparency is critical for accountability, evaluation, and policy learning. Justice decisions are often constrained by limited authority, resources, and institutional goals, so achieving greater justice in climate adaptation may require changes in the larger governance systems within which adaptation decisions are made. More nuanced evaluations of adaptation justice, more comparative analyses, enabled by greater transparency in practice, and more holistic approaches to adaptation governance are recommended moving forward.","[Siders, A.

Literatures stress the need to link Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) to make more efficient use of resources and avoid overlapping. Despite growing recognition of the necessity for such linkages, little study has yet investigated the challenges confronting integration and how best to overcome them. We conducted a systematic literature review to better articulate the rationale for integrating DRR and CCA, to identify acknowledged challenges to integration, and to provide directions for future research. The review followed PRISMA guidelines and examined 37 peer-reviewed studies on linking DRR and CCA. Key challenges in integration are found to be: lack of capacity among actors and institutions, policy gaps, mismatches, governance failure, lack of coordination, fund-shortages, and obstructive influence from the influential decision makers. These challenges are underpinned by the political economy- the nexus of influencing actors, and their interests in funding mechanisms surrounding DRR and CCA. Given the underrepresentation of political economy analysis in the literature, this study recommends the needs for an in-depth political economy analysis to determine efficient governance frameworks, improved policies, and mechanisms for effective integration of DRR and CCA in different contexts.","[Islam, Shafiqul; Smart, James C.

To map the actors involved in adaptation planning and implementation in Greece, a multicriteria analysis was performed. The SHs involved in CCA in Greece were divided into national- and regional-level stakeholders. The stakeholder analysis was based on the mapping of SHs identified through the organizational charts of relevant institutions and by other projects with a direct or indirect link to CCA. The relative importance of each stakeholder for the purposes of this analysis was assessed by evaluating their power, proximity and urgency with respect to CCA and by assigning specific weighting factors for each criterion to calculate a single priority index. Based on the priority index value, SHs were classified as low, medium or high priority for CCA at both national and regional levels. At the national level, ministerial directorates were classified as high priority, followed by academic and research centers, which were classified as medium priority. At the regional level, high index values were calculated for the Special Directorate of Environment and Spatial Planning.

This framework is based on five important accountability mechanisms: Clear responsibilities and mandates, Transparency, Political oversight, Citizen control and Checks and sanctions. For illustration purposes, the proposed framework is applied to the case of a Dutch local adaptation governance arrangement. The application shows that the five proposed mechanisms and their operationalizations offer a valid assessment of the accountability of such arrangements. It also raises some challenges, such as the tensions between accountability and flexibility, legitimacy and effectiveness; the potentially important roles of trust and of the political skills of central actor(s) in the arrangement in raising accountability, and the potential need to distinguish between arrangements for policy planning and for service delivery.","[Mees, Heleen; Driessen, Peter] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Mees, H (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands.",h.l.p.mees@uu.nl,"Driessen, Peter/M-6751-2013; Mees, Heleen/L-5394-2013","Driessen, Peter/0000-0002-0724-6666; Mees, Heleen/0000-0002-4401-6106",,,,,66,23,23,3,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

Ten SIDS are currently completing their TNAs, and 9 more will start the process in 2021. The focus of this paper is on in-country processes that have not received much attention to date. We find that an efficient TNA process is characterized by the adoption of an inclusive multi-stakeholder process, using existing institutional structures to increase ownership, and applying a learning-by-doing approach. An effective TNA process supports the formulation of national climate change policies and strategies and importantly enables the country to leverage international climate finance. For the latter, an effective TNA should address more closely the investment criteria of the Green Climate Fund. The lessons learned are shared to better inform forthcoming TNA processes in SIDS.","[Deenapanray, Prakash N.

A broad characterisation of the study area was conducted, identifying existing resources to further develop a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis. The Hydrology toolset outputs, precipitation events records, and survey results were used to identify flood-prone areas. The opportunities and threats identified were further used to develop the transition strategy, which is focused on critical areas identified and supported by BMPs, including source control, attenuation, treatment and infiltration measures, permeable pavements, rainwater harvesting systems, and bioretention basins.

By pricing risk, insurance provides incentives for reducing risks and adapting to climate change; if these premiums are not affordable to the most vulnerable, donors can combine premium support with risk-reduction measures. In this paper, we examine the costs, benefits and risks of public-private (and donor supported) insurance programmes that offer affordable economic security to vulnerable communities and governments. Insurance mechanisms are of particular interest to climate negotiators seeking strategies that help vulnerable countries adapt to increasing severity and frequency of weather disasters, and we examine the case for including insurance mechanisms in a climate adaptation strategy expected to be agreed in Copenhagen in 2009. We present a proposal for this purpose that has been recently put forward by the Munich Climate Insurance Initiative (MCII), which calls for international solidarity for very low probability and high consequence weather-related events (high- risk layer). For middle-layer risks the MCII proposal calls for international support to promote sustainable, affordable and incentive-compatible insurance programmes that serve the poor without crowding out private sector involvement.

However, NBT is especially vulnerable to changes in climate, such as shifts in weather patterns, and changes in environmental conditions that can directly influence outdoor recreation experiences. Communities, parks, and protected areas in NBT destinations have started to respond to climate change threats by assessing their adaptive capacity and planning adaptation strategies. Climate adaptation planning within NBT destinations necessitate local support and the leveraging of proximate resources. Yet, strategies to integrate visitors into climate adaptation efforts is not common, even though visitors' support for climate change planning and policy may be high. Little is known about the relationship between visitors' support for adaptation planning and their sociodemographic characteristics, their perceptions of climate-related risks, or the meanings they assign to destinations affected by climate change. In this study, we analyze visitors' personal attributes, trip characteristics, unique emotional ties and perceptions of the places they visit in relation to their willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a license plate that would direct funds toward regional climate adaptation planning. Survey data were collected on-site with NBT visitors and analyzed using binary logistic regression models. Results showed a WTP $30 annually is significantly influenced by increased income, age, climaterelated risk perceptions, and place meanings. Similarly, WTP more than the initial bid (i.e., >$30/year) for climate change adaptation and planning is significantly predicted by increased income and destination loyalty, as well as negative perceptions of climate change risks. This study contributes to a broader understanding of how recreationists and visitors can be incorporated into climate adaptation planning, demonstrating the possibility of a novel funding source.","[McCreary, Allie; Fatoric, Sandra; Seekamp, Erin] NC State Univ, Dept Pk Recreat & Tourism Management, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Smith, Jordan W.] Utah State Univ, Inst Outdoor Recreat & Tourism, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Smith, Jordan W.] Utah State Univ, Dept Environm & Soc, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Kanazawa, Mark] Carleton Coll, Dept Econ, Northfield, MN 55057 USA; [Davenport, Mae A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Davenport, Mae A.] Univ Minnesota, Ctr Changing Landscapes, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",North Carolina State University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Carleton College; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Seekamp, E (corresponding author), NC State Univ, Dept Pk Recreat & Tourism Management, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",elseekam@ncsu.edu,"Smith, Jordan/GVU-3480-2022; Smith, Jordan/AAR-9126-2021","Smith, Jordan/0000-0001-7036-4887; Seekamp, Erin/0000-0001-5082-1921; Fatoric, Sandra/0000-0002-3712-0749","Minnesota Sea Grant College Program - NOAA office of Sea Grant, United States Department of Commerce [R/CC-05-14]","Minnesota Sea Grant College Program - NOAA office of Sea Grant, United States Department of Commerce","This work is the result of research sponsored by the Minnesota Sea Grant College Program supported by the NOAA office of Sea Grant, United States Department of Commerce, under grant No. R/CC-05-14.",,74,18,18,1,25,SAGAMORE PUBL LLC,URBANA,"1807 N FEDERAL DR, URBANA, IL 61801 USA",0735-1968,2160-6862,,J PARK RECREAT ADM,J.

Recently, scholars have extended psychosocial frameworks of individual behavioral responses to natural hazards and human health risks to the domain of climate change. However, findings about the relative influence of people's appraisals of risk and the potential to respond in ways that reduce risk on behavior have been mixed. The lack of consistent findings suggests a potential need to refine frameworks for the context of climate change. Through focus group interviews and qualitative data analysis, we investigated influences on behavioral adaptation to climate change among owners of small woodlands in the Upper Midwest, USA. We compared our findings with published psychosocial frameworks and developed a conceptual model of behavioral adaptation to climate change in managed forests that identifies perceived complexity as an important element of risk appraisal, and a variable that connects risk appraisal and response appraisal, potentially transforming response appraisal into a variable that mediates the influence of risk appraisal on response.","[Fischer, Alexandra Paige; Russo, Michal; Powers, Garrett] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 49109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Fischer, AP (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 49109 USA.",apfisch@umich.edu,"Fischer, Alexandra Paige/D-4068-2016","Fischer, Alexandra Paige/0000-0003-2274-1689","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntireStennis Program [1011135]; USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station, University of Michigan Energy Institute, University of Michigan Graham Sustainability Institute","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntireStennis Program; USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station, University of Michigan Energy Institute, University of Michigan Graham Sustainability Institute","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntireStennis Program, 1011135.

The objectives were to identify: i) climate change vulnerabilities affecting forest ecosystems and forest management, ii) adaptation options to decrease these vulnerabilities, and iii) current EBFM practices impeding or facilitating the integration of climate change adaptations in forest management. Several features of EBFM, like promoting ecosystem resilience and using an adaptive management framework, may facilitate the integration of adaptation measures into the current forest management approach.

Sedentary grazing with substantial external inputs has increased the cost of livestock production. As a result, the livelihoods of herders have become more vulnerable to climate variability and change. Sedentary grazing is the formal institutional arrangement in Inner Mongolia, China. However, this may not be an efficient institutional arrangement for climate change adaptation. Self-organized local institutions for climate change adaptation have emerged and are under development in the study area. In this study, we did exploratory analyses of multiple local institutions for climate change adaptation in the Mongolian grasslands, using an agent-based modeling approach. Empirical studies from literature and our field work show that sedentary grazing, pasture rental markets, and reciprocal pasture-use groups are three popular institutional arrangements in the study area. First, we modeled the social-ecological performance (i.e., livelihood benefits to herders and grassland quality) of these institutions and their combinations under different climate conditions. Second, we did exploratory analyses of multiple social mechanisms for facilitating and maintaining cooperative use of pastures among herders. The modeling results show that in certain value-ranges of some model parameters with assumed values, reciprocal pasture-use groups had better performance than pasture rental markets; and the comparative advantage of cooperative use of pastures over sedentary grazing without cooperation becomes more evident with the increase in drought probability. Agent diversity and social norms were effective for facilitating the development of reciprocal pasture-use groups. Kin selection and punishments on free-riders were useful for maintaining cooperation among herders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The risks in Ontario - Canada's most populous province - include increasing temperatures, more frequent and intense extreme weather events, and alterations to precipitation regimes. Socio-economic-demographic patterns could magnify the implications climate change has for Ontario, including the presence of rapidly growing vulnerable populations, exacerbation of warming trends by heat-islands in large urban areas, and connectedness to global transportation networks. This study examines climate change adaptation in the public health sector in Ontario using information from interviews with government officials. Methods: Fifty-three semi-structured interviews were conducted, four with provincial and federal health officials and 49 with actors in public health and health relevant sectors at the municipal level. We identify adaptation efforts, barriers and opportunities for current and future intervention. Results: Results indicate recognition that climate change will affect the health of Ontarians. Health officials are concerned about how a changing climate could exacerbate existing health issues or create new health burdens, specifically extreme heat (71%), severe weather (68%) and poor air-quality (57%). Adaptation is currently taking the form of mainstreaming climate change into existing public health programs. While adaptive progress has relied on local leadership, federal support, political will, and inter-agency efforts, a lack of resources constrains the sustainability of long-term adaptation programs and the acquisition of data necessary to support effective policies. Conclusions: This study provides a snapshot of climate change adaptation and needs in the public health sector in Ontario. Public health departments will need to capitalize on opportunities to integrate climate change into policies and programs, while higher levels of government must improve efforts to support local adaptation and provide the capacity through which local adaptation can succeed.","[Paterson, Jaclyn A.; Ford, James D.; Ford, Lea Berrang; Lesnikowski, Alexandra] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; [Berry, Peter] Hlth Canada, Climate Change & Hlth Off, Ottawa, ON K1A 0K9, Canada; [Henderson, Jim] McGill Univ, Life Sci Lib, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; [Heymann, Jody] Meredith, Inst Hlth & Social Policy, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A3, Canada",McGill University; Health Canada; McGill University,"Paterson, JA (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Burnside Hall,805 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",jpater10@gmail.com,"Ford, James/A-4284-2013; Berrang Ford, Lea/H-5965-2013","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456; Berrang Ford, Lea/0000-0001-9216-8035; Heymann, Jody/0000-0003-0008-4198",Canadian Institute of Health Research; Canadian Foundation of Climate and Atmospheric Sciences,Canadian Institute of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Canadian Foundation of Climate and Atmospheric Sciences,"This study was funded by the Canadian Institute of Health Research and the Canadian Foundation of Climate and Atmospheric Sciences.

Although the application of urban NbS is flourishing, there is little synthesized evidence clarifying the contribution of NbS in addressing the intertwined CBS challenges and their capacity to encourage transformational change in urban systems worldwide. We map and analyse NbS approaches specifically for climate change adaptation across 216 urban interventions and 130 cities worldwide. Results suggest that current NbS practices are limited in how they may comprehensively address CBS challenges, particularly by accounting for multidimensional forms of climate vulnerability, social justice, the potential for collaboration between public and private sectors and diverse cobenefits. Data suggest that knowledge and practice are biased towards the Global North, under-representing key CBS challenges in the Global South, particularly in terms of climate hazards and urban ecosystems involved. Our results also point out that further research and practice are required to leverage the transformative potential of urban NbS. We provide recommendations for each of these areas to advance the practice of NbS for transformative urban adaptation within the CBS nexus. Nature-based solutions for climate adaptation are not comprehensively addressing the climate-biodiversity-society nexus, limiting their capacity to promote urban transformation.

Through semistructured interviews we used qualitative analyses to identify barriers to adaptation, including subjective (cognitive and experiential) and structural barriers (social, political, and economic) by comparing individual cases. Overall, we found that intentional climate change adaptation had low salience among participants, though a large majority of forest owners were active managers motivated by other goals, contributing to widespread incidental adaptation. We found that nonindustrial private forest owners who engaged in or considered intentional climate adaptation actions generally believed that anthropogenic climate change is occurring. Many respondents perceived local environmental change, notably reduced snowpack, but this was not associated with adaptive actions or intentions. The few participants who considered or implemented intentional climate adaptation actions generally had written forest management plans containing both forest inventories and specific management goals. Improving access to resources for forest management planning may enhance fire- and climate-smart forest management by facilitating scenario visioning and formalizing intentions. Although climate change beliefs were subjective barriers to intentional climate adaptation, many of the same structural barriers limited intentional and incidental adaptation. Place-based education, reliable funding mechanisms, and cooperative approaches among landowners may enhance adaptive capacity and promote the resilience of these nonindustrial private forestlands.","[Boag, Angela E.; Hartter, Joel] Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Hartter, Joel; Hamilton, Lawrence C.; Ducey, Mark J.] Univ New Hampshire, Carsey Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Hamilton, Lawrence C.] Univ New Hampshire, Sociol Dept, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Christoffersen, Nils D.] Wallowa Resources, Enterprise, OR USA; [Stevens, Forrest R.] Univ Louisville, Dept Geog & Geosci, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Palace, Michael W.] Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Palace, Michael W.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Earth Sci, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Ducey, Mark J.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Durham, NH 03824 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University of Louisville; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Boag, AE (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",,"Boag, Angela Elaine/S-5252-2019","Hamilton, Lawrence/0000-0003-1977-0649","United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) [2014-68002-21782]; NIFA [2014-68002-21782, 687305] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"This work is supported by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) (2014-68002-21782).

The article suggests that increasing attention to resilience and adaptation among humanitarian actors may not lead to reduced vulnerability because resources tend to be captured through existing power structures, directed by who you know and your place in the social hierarchy. In turn, this sustains rather than challenges the marginalisation processes that cause vulnerability to climate shocks and stressors.

Humanitarian actions, while often having short-term and 'neutral' intentions, necessarily influence the development pathways that define people's vulnerability to climate change. On the one hand, humanitarian interventions risk reinforcing existing vulnerability patterns by increasing the gap between those who benefit from different programmes and those that remain marginalised. On the other, addressing climate change may provide new opportunities for transforming the development pathways that create vulnerability in the first place. However, while there are shifts at the policy level towards integrating humanitarian assistance with longer-term development, considerations about how humanitarian action may support transformational adaptation are often missing. This article describes a framework for integrating climate change adaptation concerns into humanitarian policies and actions, which has been developed in collaboration with several humanitarian organisations to support efforts to reduce longer-term vulnerability and the recurrence of humanitarian crises.","[Nagoda, Sigrid; Eriksen, Siri] Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Fac Landscape & Soc, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragric, As, Norway; [Hetland, Oivind] Norwegian Red Cross, Oslo, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Nagoda, S (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Fac Landscape & Soc, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragric, As, Norway.",sigrid.nagoda@nmbu.no; siri.eriksen@nmbu.no; oivind.hetland@redcross.no,,,,,,,23,2,2,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0265-5012,1759-5436,,IDS BULL-I DEV STUD,IDS Bull.-Inst.

Climate-induced rural-urban migration is a profound concern, and Dhaka's political leaders have embraced technology-based innovation as one solution pathway. This article explores the societal impact of Dhaka's innovation environment strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation. Employing a case study qualitative methodology, our three findings expand knowledge about innovation for urban climate adaptation and mitigation as understood by Dhaka-based entrepreneurs. First, the most effective innovations were not the most technologically advanced, but those with the highest degree of participant ownership. Second, gaps between recipient, corporate and governmental understandings of effective mitigation and adaptation harmed projects were driven by different definitions of risk and competing understandings of vulnerability. Third, even the most technical climate adaptation measures were inherently political in their application. We discuss how to better position urban climate innovation infrastructures in Bangladesh and beyond, including developing a better recognition of innovation lifecycles for urban climate adaptation and widening our definitions of innovation to better incorporate more effective and inclusive climate adaptation solutions.","[Miklian, Jason] Univ Oslo, Ctr Dev & Environm, N-0484 Oslo, Norway; [Hoelscher, Kristian] Peace Res Inst Oslo PRIO, N-0186 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo; Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO),"Miklian, J (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Ctr Dev & Environm, N-0484 Oslo, Norway.",jason.miklian@sum.uio.no; hoelscher@prio.org,,"Miklian, Jason/0000-0003-1227-0975",Norwegian Research Council [259906/E50],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"This work is supported by funding from the Norwegian Research Council as part of the project Learning Flexibility: Complexity, Innovation & Inter-Urban Knowledge Transfer, project number 259906/E50.",,98,2,2,3,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2020,12,21,,,,,,,9115,10.3390/su12219115,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12219115,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OX4UX,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000593562600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The research explored the question: 'How are Cuban youth engaging with climate change adaptation challenges and what can we learn from it?'. The objectives of the research were to understand young people's attitudes towards climate change and environmental work while connecting a youth network in Cuba and encourage collaboration. This article contributes to PAR with a rich description of a research process in which the group of co-researchers was able to collectively shift their awareness of and personal relationship with nature. Proposing a conversation between Heron and Reason's extended epistemology (1997) and Scharmer's TheoryU (2016, 2018), I argue that experiential knowledge in climate change and environmental work looks like entering an intimate state of co-presencing with the aliveness of the earth. Second of all, the research contributes to the literature on youth participation highlighting that in Cuba there is a gap between the political will and attention towards climate change adaptation, which is remarkable, and young people's ability to meaningfully take leadership in such efforts.","[Gioacchino, Gioel] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Lib Rd, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England; [Gioacchino, Gioel] Recrear Int, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Sussex,"Gioacchino, G (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Lib Rd, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England.",gioel@recrear.info,,,UN-Habitat Youth Fund,UN-Habitat Youth Fund,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research was funded by the UN-Habitat Youth Fund.",,28,1,1,0,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1476-7503,1741-2617,,ACTION RES-LONDON,Action Res.,MAR,2019,17,1,,,SI,,108,129,,10.1177/1476750319829208,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1476750319829208,,,22,"Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,HP1JY,,Bronze,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000461424200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The research conclusions show that the adaptation actions can significantly reduce the poverty vulnerability of farmers, especially the future incidence of poverty in agricultural or poor households to a greater extent, which is characterized by a pro-poor effect. Adaptation actions can reduce poverty from two aspects: decreasing the expected income volatility (loss mitigation effect) and increasing the expected income level (opportunity effect), and the former is stronger than the latter.

At the same time, the adaptive capacity of local governance is highly context sensitive, making a one-size fits all approach inappropriate. Thus, a versatile methodological approach for application in various local contexts is required. There are several indicator-based local governance assessment methods for evaluating the effectiveness of local governance for climate change adaptation. However, they fall short of identifying and prioritizing between key factors within local governance for enhancing adaptive capacity and driving positive change. Building on adaptation theory, the authors propose combining two methodological approaches, the Capital Approach Framework for evaluating the adaptive capacity of local governance and Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping for identifying leverage points, into one integrated modeling approach, which can be applied by local researchers. This paper describes the process and benefits of combining the methodological approaches, with an example provided assupporting information. Assisting decision-makers and policy planners from subnational governance in identifying leverage points to focus and maximize impact of capacity-enhancing measures would make a key contribution for successful implementation of the UNFCCC National Adaptation Plans.","[Williams, D.

This concept is applied on the eco-city of Augustenborg in Malmo, Sweden, where Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) were implemented in 1998. ClimateCafe Malmo evaluated these NBS with 20 young professionals from nine nationalities and seven disciplines with a variety of practical tools. In two days, 175 NBS were mapped and categorised in Malmo. Results show that the selected green infrastructure have a satisfactory infiltration capacity and low values of potential toxic element pollutants after 20 years in operation. The question Is capacity building achieved by interdisciplinary field experience related to climate change adaptation? was answered by interviews, collecting data of water quality, pollution, NBS and heat stress mapping, and measuring infiltration rates, followed by discussion. The interdisciplinary workshops with practical tools provide a tangible value to the participants and are needed to advance sustainability efforts. Long term lessons learnt from Augustenborg will help stormwater managers within planning of NBS.

However, government staff in key implementing ministries need to be empowered to ensure effective delivery of policy goals. Motivation to act on climate change, combined with the capacity to make decisions and apply resources to programmes, is crucial. Informed by theories of motivation and workplace environments from social psychology and organisational theory, this paper reports findings from a questionnaire of government staff (103 respondents) in Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia. The questionnaire was designed using self-determination theory to investigate the role of external influences, institutional structures and resources and how these, in turn, affect staff motivation and capacities to design and implement new policies and strategies. The study finds that whilst external influences and hierarchical structures are recognised, these do not have a strong direct influence on staff motivation, but they do appear to inhibit capacities to act. The results show that lack of staff and limited government-allocated budget reduce the ability of ministries to be self-determined and set their own agendas. Instead they are dependent on donor-determined projects which may be selective in the aspects of climate change adaptation plans and policies they support and even divert focus away from government priorities.","[Pardoe, Joanna; Conway, Declan] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Vincent, Katharine] Kulima Integrated Dev Solut, Postnet Suite H79,Private Bag X9118, ZA-3200 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Vincent, Katharine] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Architecture & Planning, Private Bag X3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Witwatersrand,"Pardoe, J (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",j.pardoe@lse.ac.uk; katharine@kulima.com; d.conway@lse.ac.uk,"Conway, Declan/HCH-7778-2022; Vincent, Katharine/L-5669-2019","Vincent, Katharine/0000-0003-3152-1522; Conway, Declan/0000-0002-4590-6733","UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/M020398/1, NE/M020010/1]; UK Government's Department for International Development (DFID); Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; ESRC [ES/R009708/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [NE/M020010/1, NE/M020398/1] Funding Source: UKRI",UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); UK Government's Department for International Development (DFID); Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work was carried out under the Future Climate for Africa UMFULA project, with financial support from the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), grant refs: NE/M020398/1 and NE/M020010/1; and the UK Government's Department for International Development (DFID).

What agricultural strategies are needed to meet these challenges? To what extent are there synergies among these strategies? This paper examines these issues for smallholder producers in Kenya across several agroecological zones. Several practices emerge as triple wins, supporting climate adaptation, greenhouse gas mitigation, and profitability goals. In particular, integrated soil fertility management and improved livestock feeding are shown to provide multiple benefits across all agroecological zones examined. Triple wins of other agricultural practices are limited to specific agroecological zones. Irrigation and soil and water conservation, for example, are essential for adaptation, mitigation, and profitability in arid areas. The results suggest that agricultural investments targeted toward these triple-win strategies will have the greatest payoff in terms of increased resilience of farm and pastoralist households and global climate change mitigation. To reap the benefits of triple-win strategies will require that policymakers, researchers, and practitioners move away from isolated approaches focused on either adaptation or mitigation or rural income generation toward a more holistic assessment of joint strategies as well as their tradeoffs and synergies.","[Bryan, Elizabeth; Ringler, Claudia; Koo, Jawoo] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Okoba, Barrack] Kenya Agr Res Inst Kabete, Nairobi, Kenya; [Herrero, Mario; Silvestri, Silvia] Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi 00100, Kenya",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Bryan, E (corresponding author), Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",e.bryan@cgiar.org,"Koo, Jawoo/F-9397-2010; Herrero, Mario/A-6678-2015; Koo, Jawoo/HNR-9802-2023; Ford, James/A-4284-2013","Koo, Jawoo/0000-0003-3424-9229; Herrero, Mario/0000-0002-7741-5090; Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456; Bryan, Elizabeth/0000-0002-0906-222X; Ringler, Claudia/0000-0002-8266-0488",World Bank through the Trust Fund for Environmentally & Socially Sustainable Development (TFESSD),World Bank through the Trust Fund for Environmentally & Socially Sustainable Development (TFESSD),"The project was supported by the World Bank through the Trust Fund for Environmentally & Socially Sustainable Development (TFESSD).

This is done by an in-depth analysis of climate change adaptation in the Water supply and Wastewater (WW) sector of the Stockholm region. Observed adaptations are categorized in terms of building adaptive capacity and implementing adaptive decisions, and these measures are analyzed using a model of the adaptation process based on organizational learning theories. In particular, the concept of an organization's actual adaptation space is defined and used as a means to understand the adaptation options that different WW organizations can pursue, as well as why such options might be pursued. The paper finds that most adaptation measures in the WW sector of the Stockholm region are aimed at building the adaptive capacity of the sector. It also finds that the extent to which adaptation measures can be pursued by the WW organizations is determined principally by how able the organization is to justify the additional resources required for adaptation. The analysis shows that there are two main routes to address this: use of climate knowledge to argue that adaptation is needed, and reference to rules and regulations to show that it is required.","[Rudberg, Peter M.; Wallgren, Oskar; Swartling, Asa Gerger] Stockholm Environm Inst, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Swartling, Asa Gerger] Stockholm Resilience Ctr, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm Environment Institute; Stockholm University,"Rudberg, PM (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Kraftriket 2B, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",peter.rudberg@sei-international.org,"Swartling, Åsa C Gerger/J-1420-2018","Swartling, Åsa C Gerger/0000-0003-3616-7323","Mistra (the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research) through the Swedish Research Programme on Climate, Impacts and Adaptation (Mistra-SWECIA)","Mistra (the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research) through the Swedish Research Programme on Climate, Impacts and Adaptation (Mistra-SWECIA)","This article was made possible through funding from Mistra (the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research) through the Swedish Research Programme on Climate, Impacts and Adaptation (Mistra-SWECIA).

Design/methodology/approach - A framework of vulnerability and adaptive capacity to the effects of climate change is employed. Data are obtained through qualitative research conducted through interviews and focus groups with stakeholders and people playing a role in water governance in Saskatchewan. Findings - There have been many positive institutional developments which have improved Saskatchewan's adaptive capacity. The most promising is the creation of local watershed advisory committees that are poised to implement on-the-ground water management decisions. What is lacking, however, is a long-term comprehensive climate change and adaptation plan, with built-in flexibility to address present and future climate variability. Without a long-term baseline plan and vision, Saskatchewan rural communities and the agricultural sector will remain vulnerable to present and future climate-induced water stress. Practical implications - The research shows a need for an increased inter-disciplinary approach addressing environmental issues, and an increased need for academic-government-industry partnerships working towards capacity-building for sustainable climate change adaptation responses. Originality/value - This inter-disciplinary research study is the first of its kind conducted in this region of Canada, and blends contributions from physical and social scientists, government and rural stakeholders.","[Hurlbert, Margot] Univ Regina, Dept Justice Studies, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [Hurlbert, Margot] Univ Regina, Dept Sociol & Social Studies, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [Diaz, Harry; Warren, Jim] Univ Regina, Canadian Plains Res Ctr, Sociol, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [Corkal, Darrell R.] Prairie Farm Rehabil Adm & Environm, Water Qual Engn, Agr & Agri Food Canada, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",University of Regina; University of Regina; University of Regina; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada,"Hurlbert, M (corresponding author), Univ Regina, Dept Justice Studies, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.",margot.hurlbert@uregina.ca,,,,,,,54,15,15,0,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Forty-four respondents participated in this study from the decentralised departments of local authorities key informant interviews (KIIs) were used for data collection in the study areas. The study findings revealed that climate policy integration at the study districts was done as a compliance measure rather than a response to real needs of the districts. A gaping chasm therefore exists between stated and actual climate change-related goals. Lack of collaboration, weak coordination of sector plans and weak community and private sector engagement were identified as the causal factors of the gap between the rhetoric and reality of integrating climate change concerns into district development plans in the study areas. Further, competing local priorities on the district agenda, institutional capacity constraints and information and technological constraints were identified as major barriers for the local authorities in adaptation to climate change. It is concluded that although climate change and its related policies have been integrated into the various national development policies, climate policy integration remains a challenge at the district level.","[Adzei, Francis Anderson] Univ Ghana, Univ Ghana Business Sch, Dept Publ Admin & Hlth Serv Management, POB Lg 78, Legon, Greater Accra, Ghana; [Alornu, Mawusi Adzo] Univ Ghana, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Behav Environm & Occupat Hlth, Legon, Ghana",University of Ghana; University of Ghana,"Adzei, FA (corresponding author), Univ Ghana, Univ Ghana Business Sch, Dept Publ Admin & Hlth Serv Management, POB Lg 78, Legon, Greater Accra, Ghana.",fadzei@ug.edu.gh,,,,,,,32,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,MAR 4,2023,28,3,,,,,322,330,,10.1080/13549839.2022.2136641,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2022.2136641,,NOV 2022,9,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,9F7XU,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000879989300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The use of heat early warning and response systems (HEWSs) that integrate weather forecasts with risk assessment, communication, and reduction activities is increasingly widespread. HEWSs are frequently touted as an adaptation to climate change, but little attention has been paid to the question of how best to ensure effectiveness of HEWSs as climates change further. In this paper, we discuss findings showing that HEWSs satisfy the tenets of an intervention that facilitates adaptation, but climate change poses challenges infrequently addressed in heat action plans, particularly changes in the onset, duration, and intensity of dangerously warm temperatures, and changes over time in the relationships between temperature and health outcomes. Iterative management should be central to a HEWS, and iteration cycles should be of 5 years or less. Climate change adaptation and implementation science research frameworks can be used to identify HEWS modifications to improve their effectiveness as temperature continues to rise, incorporating scientific insights and new understanding of effective interventions. We conclude that, at a minimum, iterative management activities should involve planned reassessment at least every 5 years of hazard distribution, population-level vulnerability, and HEWS effectiveness.","[Hess, Jeremy J.; Ebi, Kristie L.] Univ Washington, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth Sci, 4225 Roosevelt Way NE 100, Seattle, WA 98125 USA; [Hess, Jeremy J.; Ebi, Kristie L.] Univ Washington, Dept Global Hlth, Sch Med, 4225 Roosevelt Way NE 100, Seattle, WA 98125 USA; [Hess, Jeremy J.; Ebi, Kristie L.] Univ Washington, Dept Global Hlth, Sch Publ Hlth, 4225 Roosevelt Way NE 100, Seattle, WA 98125 USA; [Hess, Jeremy J.] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Emergency Med, 4225 Roosevelt Way NE 100, Seattle, WA 98125 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Hess, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, 4225 Roosevelt Way NE 100, Seattle, WA 98125 USA.",jjhess@uw.edu,,,,,,,54,38,38,0,17,BLACKWELL SCIENCE PUBL,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0EL, ENGLAND",,,,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2016,1382,,,,,,21,30,,10.1111/nyas.13258,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nyas.13258,,,10,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Multidisciplinary Sciences",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Science & Technology - Other Topics",BG6ZA,27788557,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000391044200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper is a systematic literature review to describe the usage trends, scope, and nature of the inclusive approach in the climate change adaptation (CCA) context. We developed search algorithms, explicit selection criteria, and a coding questionnaire, which we used to review a total of 106 peer-reviewed articles, 145 grey literature documents, and 67 national communications to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC); 318 documents were reviewed in total. Quantitatively, the methodology reveals a slight increase in usage, with a focus on non-Annex 1 countries, gender issues, and capacity building. Qualitatively, we arranged the key insights into the following three categories: (1) inclusion in who or what adapts; (2) motivating inclusive processes; and (3) anticipated outcomes of inclusive CCA. We conclude, with the observation, that many issues also apply to Annex 1 countries. We also argue that the common language nature of the word `inclusive' makes it applicable to other CCA-relevant contexts, including government subsidies, science policy, knowledge integration and mobilization, performance measurement, and the breadth of the moral circle that a society should adopt.","[Pham, Ha; Saner, Marc] Univ Ottawa, Dept Geog Environm & Geomat, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Pham, H (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Geog Environm & Geomat, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",hpham048@uottawa.ca; msaner@uottawa.ca,,"Pham, Ha/0000-0003-3266-1789; Saner, Marc/0000-0002-6669-5138",,,,,135,2,2,4,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2021,13,19,,,,,,,10617,10.3390/su131910617,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su131910617,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YZ9FG,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000755774900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Success in contributing to this goal depends on what types of GSI are being used and how they are sized. Here we review GSI design storm requirements for the seven Urban Resilience to Extremes Sustainability Research Network (UREx SRN) cities in the United States. We find that while GSI in most of our study cities is designed for smaller, more common precipitation events (e.g., 1-year event) considered by current water quality regulations; GSI in several UREx cities is primarily focused on flood control and require design for much larger storms (e.g., 100-year events). In order for GSI to contribute to climate change adaptation, it is critical to ensure that design guidelines align with that goal.","[McPhillips, Lauren E.] Penn State Univ, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, State Coll, PA 16801 USA; [Matsler, Marissa] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY USA; [Rosenzweig, Bernice R.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, Adv Sci Res Ctr, Environm Sci Initiat, New York, NY USA; [Kim, Yeowon] Arizona State Univ, Global Inst Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"McPhillips, LE (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, State Coll, PA 16801 USA.",stormwater@psu.edu,"Matsler, Marissa/AAU-9436-2020","Matsler, Marissa/0000-0003-3294-1991; Rosenzweig, Bernice/0000-0002-4888-3653",National Science Foundation [1444755],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [1444755].,,38,16,16,12,33,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2378-9689,2378-9697,,SUSTAIN RESIL INFRAS,Sustain.

The Risk Compensation Hypothesis suggests that remedies to reduce the impacts of risky behaviors can unintentionally increase those behaviors. The Risk Salience Hypothesis suggests that information about adaptation may increase the salience of impacts, and therefore increase mitigation support. Experiment 1 presented participants with a news article about an irrigation technology described as a way to improve efficiency (Pure Control), reduce emissions (Mitigation Control), or reduce drought vulnerability (Adaptation). Political moderates in the adaptation condition rated climate change as a higher political priority and were more supportive of a policy to subsidize the technology than those in both controls. Results were not replicated in Experiment 2. These results partially support the Risk Salience Hypothesis. There was no evidence to justify the concern that discussing adaptation will reduce support for mitigation or concern about climate change. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

These same goods and services are constantly surrounded by emerging markets linking remote communities with major urban centers nationally and internationally. How these markets affect adaptation remains unclear. This paper examines the roles of markets in non-timber forest products that normally serve as safety nets for forest communities, and the implications for climate change adaptation in the Congo Basin. Following the identification and prioritization of forest-based development sectors for adaptation by stakeholders, the types of markets and trades surrounding the identified sectors were examined in two provinces in the Democratic Republic of Congo as a case study in order to evaluate revenue flows and their potential contribution to adaptation by local communities. The distribution of the market revenue leaves local people with returns much lower than the worth of the commodity, while wholesalers and retailers reap most of the benefits and profit from the high variability in volume and market earnings for the same commodity across provinces. Markets may increase the value of a commodity as observed in this study, but their contributions to adaptation appear highly limited for local communities following their distribution among the stakeholders in the market chain. This is likely to be worse in free market settings, especially when it diminishes the safety net roles of forest goods and services. Markets should therefore complement rather than substitute forests roles for adaptation to climate change in tropical forest countries. Capturing the benefits of trade for adaptation is crucial but will require policy reforms and further research that addresses the complexity in benefit sharing. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results show that most farmers in the study area have adopted adaptation strategies to cope with climate change. The farmers' livelihood capital plays an important role in their adoption of adaptation strategies. Specifically, natural capital and social capital have a positive impact on farmers' decisions about climate change adaptation strategies. Human capital and physical capital are inclined to promote farmers' adoption of climate change adaptation strategies. The results of this study are helpful for improving our understanding of how livelihood capital influences climate change adaptation strategies among farmers, which can provide implications for planning more effective adaptation programs.","[Kuang, Foyuan; Jin, Jianjun; He, Rui; Wan, Xinyu; Ning, Jing] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Kuang, Foyuan; Jin, Jianjun; He, Rui; Wan, Xinyu; Ning, Jing] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Sch Nat Resources, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University,"Jin, JJ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",jjjin@bnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41671170, 41771192]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We would like to thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41671170, 41771192) for providing financial support to undertake this study.

Assessing whether such trends threaten farmers' long-term adaptive capacity requires a thorough understanding of changes in their crop portfolios, identification of the drivers of change, and the implications such changes have for local nutrition and food production. We reviewed the available literature on farmers' reports of climate-driven crop changes. Small-scale farmers tend to adopt water-demanding crops, even in areas where models predict that reduced rainfall will reduce yields. The adoption of horticultural cash-crops combined with the abandonment of subsistence cereals modifies farmers' nutritional inputs in terms of calories and nutrients, potentially undermining their food security. Farmers' knowledge contributes to understand trends in crop diversity and support the design of strategies for adaptation to climate change.","[Labeyrie, Vanesse; Morel, Antoine] CIRAD, UMR SENS, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Labeyrie, Vanesse; Morel, Antoine] Univ Montpellier, UPVM, CIRAD, SENS,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Renard, Delphine; Aumeeruddy-Thomas, Yildiz; Caillon, Sophie; Demongeot, Marilou; Locqueville, Jonathan] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, CNRS, CEFE,EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Benyei, Petra; Calvet-Mir, Laura; Junqueira, Andre Braga; Li, Xiaoyue; Mattalia, Giulia; Minarro, Sara; Porcuna-Ferrer, Anna; Schlingmann, Anna; Reyes-Garcia, Victoria] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Carriere, Stephanie M.; Descamps, Elsa] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, IRD Montpellier, UMR Governance Risk Environm & Dev GRED, Montpellier 5, France; [Mattalia, Giulia] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Via Torino 155, I-30172 Venice, Italy; [da Cunha Avila, Julia Vieira] Natl Inst Amazonian Res, Grad Program Bot, BR-69067375 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Reyes-Garcia, Victoria] Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain",CIRAD; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Institute Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia; ICREA,"Labeyrie, V (corresponding author), CIRAD, UMR SENS, F-34398 Montpellier, France.;Labeyrie, V (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, UPVM, CIRAD, SENS,IRD, Montpellier, France.",vanesse.labeyrie@cirad.fr,"Vieira da Cunha Avila, Julia/HHZ-6010-2022; Giulia, Mattalia/AAX-3149-2020; Junqueira, Andre Braga/M-1142-2016; Labeyrie, Vanesse/AAF-7767-2021; /C-4552-2008","Giulia, Mattalia/0000-0002-1947-7007; Junqueira, Andre Braga/0000-0003-3681-1705; Porcuna Ferrer, Anna/0000-0003-3887-9914; Calvet-Mir, Laura/0000-0002-7022-6342; /0000-0002-2914-8055; Renard, Delphine/0000-0002-3228-4269; Li, Xiaoyue/0000-0001-8059-1127; Minarro, Sara/0000-0001-8243-8652","ANR (French National Research Agency) under the 'Programme d'Investissements d'Avenir' [ANR-10-LABX-001-01 Labex Agro, 1702-022]; Agropolis Fondation [ANR-16-IDEX-0006]; European Research Council [FP7-771056-LICCI]; 'Programme d'Investissements d'Avenir' grant [17-MPGA-0004]; Mara de Maeztu Unit of Excellence [CEX2019-000940-M]",ANR (French National Research Agency) under the 'Programme d'Investissements d'Avenir'(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Agropolis Fondation(Agropolis Fondation); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); 'Programme d'Investissements d'Avenir' grant(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Mara de Maeztu Unit of Excellence,"This work was conducted in the framework of NetDivA project (ID 1702-022) , which was publicly funded through ANR (the French National Research Agency) under the 'Programme d'Investissements d'Avenir' reference ANR-10-LABX-001-01 Labex Agro and coordinated by Agropolis Fondation in the frame of I-SITE MUSE (ANR-16-IDEX-0006) .

This study was conducted in North-West Selangor, Malaysia to examine the WTP of farmers for climate change adaptation in the agriculture sector. Data was collected from 385 farmers in the Integrated Agricultural Development Area through face-to-face interview. A contingent valuation method (CVM) was applied as a mechanism to quantify the factors affecting WTP. This study identified that socioeconomic factors and motivational aspects act as predictors to engage in WTP for an adaptation program. The findings indicated that several factors influence the WTP for a planned adaptation program, such as the income of the farmer (beta = 0.363), their education level (beta = 0.1.638), farm size (beta = 0.341), household size (beta = 0.293), concern about environmental protection irrespective of cost (beta = 0.260), climatic impact on agricultural production (beta = 0.421) and risk concerns due to climate change (beta = 0.229). The findings describe the relevance and preferences related to WTP for the implementation of the correct adaptation policies.

In this paper, we review the farmer-focused approaches (typical of vulnerability approaches) and agro-ecosystem-focused approaches (typical of resilience approaches). We propose that a combination of the two may be a better way to conceptualize sustainable adaptation to future climate change within an agro-ecological system. To test our hypothesis, we use the case study of Iran, a land that has shown both tremendous resilience and vulnerability in its agro-ecological system. We explore the changes that have occurred in the Iranian farming system and their implications for farmers' resilience to climate change through an integrated lens combining vulnerability approaches and resilience approaches. During the previous five decades, we describe how Iranian peasants have become small farmers, the land tenure system has changed from a traditional landlord-sharecropping system to family farms, and the quantity and quality of the agro-ecological resources have changed considerably. Our integrative approach provides important insights for both research and policy. We show that combining the two approaches can have far-reaching implications for farmers' adaptation to future climate change knowledge, policy, and practice since one approach aims to decrease farmers vulnerability and the other approach aims to build resilient agro-ecosystems.","[Hashemi, Seyyed Mahmoud] Univ Tehran, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Coll Agr, Karaj, Iran; [Bagheri, Ali] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Water Resources Engn, Fac Agr, Tehran, Iran; [Marshall, Nadine] CSIRO Land & Water, Townsville, Qld, Australia",University of Tehran; Tarbiat Modares University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Hashemi, SM (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Coll Agr, Karaj, Iran.",seyyedmahmoodhashemi@gmail.com,"Marshall, Nadine/D-9339-2011","Marshall, Nadine/0000-0003-4463-3558; Hashemi, Seyyed Mahmoud/0000-0003-1252-033X",UNDP Asia-Pacific Human Development Academic Fellowship; Iran National Elites Foundation; University of Tehran Research Division,UNDP Asia-Pacific Human Development Academic Fellowship; Iran National Elites Foundation; University of Tehran Research Division,"We are grateful to anonymous reviewers for providing us with constructive comments.

Valdbjorn",,,A STRATEGIC APPROACH FOR EXISTING BUILDINGS TO WITHSTAND CLIMATE CHANGE,OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate Change; Impact; Effects; Strategy; Buildings,PERFORMANCE,"Buildings play a vital economic and social role in society and are vulnerable to climate change. This paper suggests a strategic approach for existing buildings to withstand climate change. It emphasises the most likely climate impacts, including the change in mean year values as well as the extent of maximum and minimum extremes, which are pointed out and set against a background of national and international agreements. Assumptions that form the basis for the scenarios are outlined and evaluated in a Danish context and similar evaluations can be drawn for other countries. As climate change progresses, the uncertainty of the scenarios leaves major challenges that will grow far more serious, if not addressed and taken into account in building design and into a strategy for the adaptation of existing buildings. An outline of the actions needed for developing abroad strategic approach to the adaptation to climate change for buildings is given. The actions include four stages: a survey of the performance, the impact of climate change, the vulnerability of the existing building stock and climate adaptation needs. This leads to the identification of a risk-based strategic framework for adaptation to climate change based on the results of a vulnerability analysis. In addition, this paper describes some issues that must be addressed in case a strategic approach is not developed, as the building sector is continuously investing in measures to adapt to climate change.","Aalborg Univ, Dept Construct & Hlth, Danish Bldg Res Inst, Dr Neergaards Vej 15, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Rasmussen, TV (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Dept Construct & Hlth, Danish Bldg Res Inst, Dr Neergaards Vej 15, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark.",tvr@sbi.aau.dk,,"Rasmussen, Torben Valdbjorn/0000-0003-1779-8963",,,,,25,3,3,1,10,OPEN HOUSE INT,GREAT BRITAIN,"URBAN INTERNATIONAL PRESS, PO BOX 74, GATESHEAD, TYNE & WEAR, GREAT BRITAIN, NE9 5UZ, ENGLAND",0168-2601,2633-9838,,OPEN HOUSE INT,Open House Int.,DEC,2012,37,4,,,,,81,88,,,,,,8,Architecture; Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Architecture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,068SZ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000313387800009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Current debates tend to consider actions to respond to climate change as either adaptive or maladaptive, leading to binary framings of outcomes as either successful or harmful. To address this, our article considers the vast space that exists between success and failure in climate change adaptation, highlighting the importance of applying the concepts of successful adaptation and maladaptation jointly in analyses of such outcomes. To this end, we develop an integrated framework to examine the major adaptive and maladaptive effects induced by large-scale seawater desalination. Now a major component of water supply in cities and regions around the world, desalination is increasingly viewed as an adaptation to water challenges linked with climate change. Based on a comprehensive review of the (successful/mal)adaptation literature, we present a matrix that will help academics and practitioners think through the complex and overlapping outcomes of adaptation via desalination in the water sector. We then discuss the insights concerning the configurations of desalination's adaptive and maladaptive outcomes. Overall, we present a threefold argument: (1) that examining successful outcomes alongside maladaptive ones enables a more complete and nuanced understanding of the overall effects of adaptation actions and their spatial and temporal distribution; (2) that a consideration of this can help to highlight the tradeoffs and constraints that are inherent in adaptation in order to support decision-making; and (3) that a more complex approach to adaptation outcomes can assist in problematizing the social-political drivers and consequences of adaptation.

However, empirical knowledge on associated governance processes is scarce and fragmented. Against this background, this paper examines the integration of nature-based approaches for climate change adaptation into municipalities' daily planning practices and associated governance. A city-to-city learning lab was established to systematically analyze selected urban development projects step-by-step, from the initial idea, to comprehensive and detailed planning, procurement, implementation, maintenance and follow-up. The results show the numerous constraints municipal staff face and how they use targeted strategies to overcome them and tap into existing drivers. We identify five, complementary strategies: i) targeted stakeholder collaboration; ii) strategic citizen involvement; iii) outsourcing; iv) the alteration of internal working structures; and v) concealed science-policy integration. Importantly, these strategies reveal an increasing need for relational approaches that, in turn, require individuals to develop the cognitive/ emotional capacity to establish trust, communicate inclusively and promote social learning, while at the same time dealing with an increasingly complex and uncertain working environment. We conclude that tapping into the potential of nature-based solutions for climate adaptation governance requires more financial and human resources, and capacity development to support personal development, systematic mainstreaming and, ultimately, more sustainable development.

Our goal was to quantify distribution and growth of housing around the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuge System. This is important information for conservation planning, particularly given promotion of habitat connectivity as a climate change adaptation measure. We quantified housing growth from 1940 to 2000 and projected future growth to 2030 within three distances from refuges, identifying very low housing density open space, opportunity areas (contiguous areas with < 6.17 houses/km(2)), both nationally and by USFWS administrative region. Additionally, we quantified number and area of habitat corridors within these opportunity areas in 2000. Our results indicated that the number and area of open space opportunity areas generally decreased with increasing distance from refuges and with the passage of time. Furthermore, total area in habitat corridors was much lower than in opportunity areas. In addition, the number of corridors sometimes exceeded number of opportunity areas as a result of habitat fragmentation, indicating corridors are likely vulnerable to land use change. Finally, regional differences were strong and indicated some refuges may have experienced so much housing growth already that they are effectively too isolated to adapt to climate change, while others may require extensive habitat restoration work. Wildlife refuges are increasingly isolated by residential housing development, potentially constraining the movement of wildlife and, therefore, their ability to adapt to a changing climate.","[Hamilton, Christopher M.] Nat Resources Conservat Serv Oregon, 1201 NE Lloyd Blvd, Portland, OR 97232 USA; [Baumann, Matthias; Pidgeon, Anna M.; Helmers, David P.; Radeloff, Volker C.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, SILVIS Lab, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Thogmartin, Wayne E.] US Geol Survey, Upper Midwest Environm Sci Ctr, 2630 Fanta Reed Rd, La Crosse, WI 54603 USA; [Heglund, Patricia J.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, 2630 Fanta Reed Rd, La Crosse, WI 54603 USA; [Baumann, Matthias] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Rudower Chaussee 16,Raum 2 101, Berlin, Germany",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Thogmartin, WE (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Upper Midwest Environm Sci Ctr, 2630 Fanta Reed Rd, La Crosse, WI 54603 USA.",wthogmartin@usgs.gov,"Thogmartin, Wayne/A-4461-2008; Radeloff, Volker C/B-6124-2016; Baumann, Matthias/K-4757-2014","Thogmartin, Wayne/0000-0002-2384-4279; Radeloff, Volker C/0000-0001-9004-221X; Baumann, Matthias/0000-0003-2375-3622",U.S. Geological Survey/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Science Support Program,U.S. Geological Survey/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Science Support Program,"This research was supported by the U.S. Geological Survey/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Science Support Program Partnership.

This study identifies barriers to NbS uptake by the rail industry through a systematic literature review, categorising them into seven key themes, whilst also considering potential tools to facilitate their uptake. The ongoing development of NbS standards and guidance is confirmed as a means to resolve the barriers likely to be faced.

Although entrepreneurship is widely considered an important part of such arrangements, little is known about the conditions that enable it, and its actual role is under-researched. Through an in-depth case study of an ecosystem-based adaptation project in the Netherlands, we have analyzed how the variegated actors in a governance network shape six conditions for entrepreneurial success, established in the entrepreneurship literature. Through a framing analysis, we found that all six conditions, i.e., prior career experience, altruistic motivations, financial motives, social networks, financial capital availability, and policies and regulations, were the object of constant negotiations. Their salience varied during the project as a result of variegated framing practices. In the early stages, issue, identity, and relationship frames were used to create a network of people with a range of relevant experience, connected by altruistic motivations. However, as the project progressed, distrust frames and different spatial-and temporal-scale frames created tensions between public and private actors. Accordingly, process frames, financial motivations, and capital availability became increasingly salient, reflecting the need to consolidate rules, roles, and responsibilities. The findings suggest that approaches to climate change adaptation imply ongoing struggles over the conditions that enable entrepreneurial success. We thereby add an important new dimension to the study of adaptation governance.","[de Block, Debora; van Slobbe, Erik] Wageningen Univ & Res, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Feindt, Peter H.] Humboldt Univ, Albrecht Daniel Thaer Inst Agr & Hort Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Feindt, Peter H.] Wageningen Univ, Strateg Commun, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Humboldt University of Berlin; Wageningen University & Research,"de Block, D (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",,,"van Slobbe, Erik/0000-0003-0499-2281",Climate-KIC (Knowledge and Innovation Community),Climate-KIC (Knowledge and Innovation Community),"The authors would like to thank the initiator of the inland shore Wieringermeer for the opportunity to become closely involved in the project, as well as all other persons involved in the project for their cooperation and valuable comments.

This article discusses these considerations through studies of two rural communities faced with the implementation of climate change adaptation strategies in Senegal and Kenya. The cases illustrate different approaches of institutional arrangements and scaling-up of adaptation actions from community to national levels. The lessons from the communities are typical of most vulnerable rural regions and were hence important for extended dissemination considering that the impacts of climate change in Africa are felt largely at community levels.

Minimizing the risks and impacts of climate change on forest management outcomes and reducing the vulnerability of forest management systems requires adaptation. Forest management system adaptation is a multi-scale incremental process that involves diverse actors collaborating to define issues, develop options, and implement solutions. Enabling adaptation may require revising assumptions (e.g., assumptions about stationary climate), upgrading formal and informal institutions (including mandates), re-engineering governance, addressing knowledge gaps and information management issues, and changing practices. Given the heightened uncertainty associated with climate change, adaptation also includes enhancing capacities, reducing risks through diversification, increasing flexibility, and enhancing resiliency by creating decision environments conducive to learning, foresight, knowledge integration, and adaptive management. Forest management practitioners have a fundamental role in identifying, evaluating, and implementing climate change adaptation measures. This study develops and applies a framework (derived from recent scholarship on adaptation) for assessing the perceptions of forest management practitioners about issues, challenges, and factors that they consider important relative to their potential to contribute to climate change adaptation. The framework draws from, and ties together various aspects of adaptation process including psychological factors, knowledge management, forest management capacity, institutions and governance, and the state of information methods that support forest management (i.e., planning, monitoring, and assessment). The framework is applied utilizing the results of surveys of forest practitioners in British Columbia, Canada. The application provides an opportunity to test concepts and to identify key barriers from a practitioner perspective. Proof of concept is tested by evaluating the extent to which respondents were able and willing to provide answers to survey questions. In general, responses were robust suggesting some understanding and recognition of the importance and validity of the underlying adaptation concepts by forest professionals. The results suggest that forest professionals have diverse viewpoints about climate change. The majority is concerned and support adaptation. However, a significant minority do not support modification of current forest management. Discourse, education, and engagement are called for. Other key factors that from the perspective of professionals may reduce participation potential include knowledge deficits, lack of mandate to adapt, limited resources for adaptation, institutional barriers, inadequate assessment, and persistence of planning and monitoring approaches that do not account for climate change.

Fish spawned in the rivers of one jurisdiction are vulnerable to harvest in other jurisdictions. The rocky history of attempts by the United States and Canada to cooperatively manage their respective salmon harvests suggests that such shared resources may present difficult challenges for effective adaptation to climate change. On June 30, 1999, the two nations signed an agreement which, if successfully implemented, may end several years of rancorous conflict. For the previous six years, they had been unable to agree on a full set of salmon fishing regimes under the terms of the Pacific Salmon Treaty. This conflict was sparked by strongly divergent trends in the abundance of northern and southern salmon stocks, and a consequent change in the balance of each nation's interceptions of salmon spawned in the other nation's rivers. The trends are attributable, in part, to the effects of large-scale climatic fluctuations. This case demonstrates that it may not be a simple matter to respond effectively to a climate change. Adaptation is difficult when a resource is exploited by multiple competing users who possess incomplete information. If, in addition, their incentives to cooperate are disrupted by the impacts of the climatic variation, dysfunctional breakdowns in management rather than efficient adaptation may ensue. Institutional factors will determine the extent to which the management of such resources can adapt effectively to climate variability or long-term climate change.","Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Environm & Societal Impacts Grp, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Miller, KA (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Environm & Societal Impacts Grp, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",,,"Miller, Kathleen/0000-0002-4040-5139",,,,,74,23,24,0,11,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The paper aims to contribute to this endeavor by presenting a novel framework that conceptualizes adaptations to climate change as actions. The framework is intended to systematically analyze the actor relations involved in adaptations and the barriers to their implementation. By combining established scientific action theories with terminology from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in an innovative way, it can be used to clarify the notion of adaptation used in adaptation assessments. The framework's potential is illustrated by a case study on cooling water management in the river Rhine catchment and by the elucidation of some prominent concepts in adaptation research. We show that by framing adaptations as actions, the purpose of adaptations and how they tend to connect up in means-ends-chains becomes crucial. Actors can take different functional roles as exposure unit, operator and receptor of adaptation. A mismatch of these roles can lead to barriers to adaptation, of which we deduce four types: complex actor relations, missing operators, missing means and unemployed means. The case study yields a complex bundle of adaptations, and shows that the potential barriers involved are quite diverse. There is thus no blueprint solution. Although we identify entry points for adaptation, the analysis leads to a skeptical conclusion for adapting cooling water management in the whole Rhine catchment.","[Eisenack, Klaus; Stecker, Rebecca] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Eisenack, K (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",klaus.eisenack@uni-oldenburg.de,,,German Ministry for Education and Research [01UU0910],German Ministry for Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"Parts of this paper are a work of the Chameleon Research Group (www.climate-chameleon.de), funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research under grant 01UU0910 in the FONA program (social-ecological research).

Unlike other studies of adaptation, this paper examines the differences between private irrigation and public irrigation schemes based on around 1400 farm surveys collected across seven countries in South America which recorded detailed water schemes. We analyze the choice of water schemes in the first stage and the land values for each scheme in the second stage. We find that public irrigations do not increase in response to a warmer climate, but private irrigations do. On the other hand, we find that public irrigation schemes are provided primarily as a response to water scarcity. Moreover, we find that private irrigations are taken gradually while public irrigations are provided as a lump sum, resulting in either too much or too little provision. Therefore, public adaptations to climate change will likely involve two inefficiencies. No provision of irrigation in a hotter climate may result from a lack of knowledge. Overprovision of irrigation in dry zones may result from a lump-sum provision of a public good. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We conceptualize sustainability from a social systemic perspective, that is, from a perspective that encompasses the multiple functionalities of a social system and their interrelationships in particular environmental contexts. The systems perspective is applied in our consideration and analysis of disaster risk reduction (DRR), climate change adaptation (CCA), and sustainable development (SD). Section Sustainability and Sustainable Development introduces briefly sustainability and sustainable development, followed by a brief presentation of the theory of complex social systems (Section Social System Model). The theory conceptualizes interdependent subsystems, their multiple functionalities, and the agential and systemic responses to internal and external stressors on a social system. Section Case Studies of Response to Stressors considers disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA), emerging in response to one or more systemic stressors. It illustrates these with disaster risk reduction in the cases of food and chemical security regulation in the EU. CCA is illustrated by initiatives and developments on the island of Gotland, Sweden and in the Gothenburg Metropolitan area, which go beyond a limited CCA perspective, taking into account long-term sustainability issues. Section Sustainable Development as a Societal Development System discusses the limitations of DRR and CCA, not only their technical limitations but economic, socio-cultural, and political limitations, as informed from a sustainability perspective. It is argued that DRRs are only partial subsystems and must be considered and assessed in the context of a more encompassing systemic perspective. Part of the discussion is focused on the distinction between sustainable and non-sustainable DRRs and CCAs. Section Concluding Remarks presents a few concluding remarks about the importance of a systemic perspective in analyzing DRR and CCA as well as other similar subsystems in terms of sustainable development.","[Burns, Tom R.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Sociol, S-75126 Uppsala, Sweden; [Burns, Tom R.; Des Johansson, Nora Machado] Univ Inst Lisbon, Ctr Res Sociol, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal",Uppsala University; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Burns, TR (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Sociol, S-75126 Uppsala, Sweden.;Burns, TR (corresponding author), Univ Inst Lisbon, Ctr Res Sociol, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal.",tom.burns@soc.uu.se,,,,,,,26,3,3,2,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2017,9,2,,,,,,,293,10.3390/su9020293,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9020293,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EM8VZ,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000395590500135,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, these crops tend to be replaced by non-traditional crops with higher productivity, higher market values, and higher short-term income. In this context, smallholders face trade-offs between maximizing short-term income and ensuring resilience to face likely future climate adversities. The economic assessment of such trade-offs has been commonly neglected in the literature. Most studies are conducted using agronomic or anthropological frameworks to recognize the value of traditional agriculture to increase adaptive capacity and reduce vulnerability. This study fills this gap by assessing economic and agronomic trade-offs between traditional and non-traditional crops triggered by climate-induced changes in water availability. We also simulate the effectiveness of a water policy. Our results suggest that farmers growing traditional crops may get lower profits, but their portfolio is more resilient to climate change, whereas the water policy proves to be an effective adaptation strategy to climate change. However, the policy implementation could hinder the development of traditional crops. Based on our results, we suggest implementing smart agricultural policies to balance economic, cultural, and adaptation goals.","[Montevechio, Esteban Arias] Univ Catolica Ssma Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Concepcion, Chile; [Cunya, Marianella Crispin] Univ Nacl Agr Molina, Escuela Postgrad, Programa Doctorado Econ Recursos Nat & Desarrollo, Lima, Peru; [Cunya, Marianella Crispin] Univ Nacl Mayor San Marcos, Fac Ciencias Econ, Lima, Peru; [Jorquera, Francisco Fernandez] Univ Mayor, Fac Sci, Sch Agron, Santiago, Chile; [Jorquera, Francisco Fernandez; Vasquez-Lavin, Felipe; Oliva, Roberto Ponce D.] Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, Santiago, Chile; [Jorquera, Francisco Fernandez; Vasquez-Lavin, Felipe] Ctr Climate & Resilience Res, CR2, Santiago, Chile; [Rendon, Eric] Univ Nacl Agr La Molina, Fac Econ & Planificac, Lima, Peru; [Vasquez-Lavin, Felipe] Univ Desarrollo, Sch Business & Econ, Concepcion, Chile; [Stehr, Alejandra] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ingn, Concepcion, Chile; [Oliva, Roberto Ponce D.] Water Res Ctr Agr & Min, Concepcion, Chile",Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion; University Nacional Agraria La Molina; Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos; Universidad Mayor; University Nacional Agraria La Molina; Universidad del Desarrollo; Universidad de Concepcion,"Oliva, RDP (corresponding author), Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, Santiago, Chile.;Oliva, RDP (corresponding author), Water Res Ctr Agr & Min, Concepcion, Chile.",robertoponce@udd.cl,,,"National Agency for Research and Development (ANID) [ANID/FONDAP/15130015, PIA/BASAL FB0002]",National Agency for Research and Development (ANID),"This research was funded by the National Agency for Research and Development (ANID): ANID/FONDAP/15130015, and ANID PIA/BASAL FB0002.",,90,0,0,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The Pacific region is no exception and given the speed at which projects are being implemented it is important to extract lessons from past community-based projects more generally to inform adaptation activities now and in the future. This article draws from in-depth focus-group discussions (n = 10) in four village communities in Pele Island (Vanuatu) to understand the key factors influencing the success and failure of community-based projects (n = 34) since the late 1970s until the end of 2013. The overwhelming sense from participants is that projects have largely failed in these communities, due in part to a number of standard challenges associated with sustaining projects, including issues of finance, maintenance, management expertise and so on. But it has been the social dynamics, power relations and changing traditional norms at the community level that have been at the epicentre of project failure. This points to an urgent need for community to be re-framed as more than just the place where projects are rolled out. Instead, it needs to be a site where the socio-political context is understood and transformed to: avoid problems being built into projects; guarantee that project goals and outcomes do not exacerbate existing inequalities; and ensure that projects do not fail, weaken adaptive capacity or result in maladaptation. This article concludes with a preliminary set of four guidelines that may contribute to the climate change adaptation literature and assist practitioners and donors working with community on climate change adaptation efforts now and in the future.","[Buggy, Lisa; McNamara, Karen Elizabeth] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"McNamara, KE (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",karen.mcnamara@uq.edu.au,"McNamara, Karen/D-7322-2013","McNamara, Karen/0000-0002-4511-8403",University of Queensland,University of Queensland(University of Queensland),We are grateful to The University of Queensland for providing some funding support to undertake this work.,,40,55,56,1,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The study found that such practices, despite their feasibility, still face systemic challenges given the current planning system in China, e.g., the deficiency of climate change impact data and analyses, the absence of essential planning tools, and the unsuitability of the current planning system for the integration of adaptation actions.

This paper provides adaptation options and scopes relevant appraisal methods in agriculture focussing on livestock production specifically. We find that for many adaptation options for livestock agriculture, standard (expected) cost-benefit analysis is an appropriate tool. For adaptation options requiring long lead times or those with long lifetimes, techniques incorporating uncertainty ('robust' methods) are more suitable, including real options analysis, portfolio analysis and robust decision-making. From a comprehensive list of adaptation options in the livestock sector, we identify the most appropriate appraisal technique for each option and describe how the robust appraisal tools could be applied to heat stress, flood risk and water management.","[Dittrich, Ruth; Wreford, Anita; Topp, Cairistiona F.

The purpose of the article - to assess the technical efficiency of climate adaptation practices on cassava production in two different agro-ecological zones within the study area to know where the climate adaptation practices are more productive. To achieve the main objective of the study, the specific objectives were stated as follows: (a) describe relevant socio-economic characteristics of cassava farmers in southwestern region of Nigeria; (b) assess the influence of the used climate change adaptation strategies on technical efficiency of cassava production in both agro-ecological zones. Methodology / approach. The study was carried out in Ekiti, Osun and Oyo State in the southwestern region of Nigeria, where two different agro-ecological zones (AEZ) (rain forest and guinea savannah) were chosen for the study. The study used multi-stage sampling procedures, with well-structured questionnaire, to select 150 cassava producers from each AEZ, making a total of 300 cassava producers for the study. Data analysis was done using descriptive statistics and stochastic frontier production function. Results. From the study, it was revealed that cassava farmers in the study area were relatively young, fairly educated, mostly married, well experienced, adequately aware of climate change, but operated on a small scale. The result on the influence of climate adaptation strategies on technical efficiency of cassava production in both rain forest and savannah AEZs within the study area revealed that technical inefficiency existed in cassava production as confirmed by the gamma values of 0.687 and 0.639 in rain forest and savannah respectively Originality / scientific novelty. The study has really revealed diverse climate adaptation options available to cassava farmers in order to sustain its production as a means of employment to the unemployed, food consumption and contribution to the national gross domestic product. Studies comparing climate adaptation practices on the technical efficiency of cassava production in different agro-ecological zones in southwestern part of Nigeria are relatively scarce considering the mixture of socio-economic and climate variables to assess technical efficiency of cassava production. Practical value / implications. The study has succeeded in identifying key factors that will enables policy makers to formulate a sustained policy framework that would encourage the use of multiple climate adaptation practices by the cassava farmers. To ensure sustainability of cassava production, it is therefore recommended that farmers should use different adaptation strategies to climate change e.g crop diversification, multiple planting dates, land fragmentation, use of improved varieties and off farm income activities that would bring increase in their scale of operation as most of the cassava farmers in the study areas cultivated less than 2 hectares of land for cassava production.","[Owoeye, Rufus Sunday] Ekiti State Univ, Ado Ekiti, Nigeria",,"Owoeye, RS (corresponding author), Ekiti State Univ, Ado Ekiti, Nigeria.",,,,,,,,13,0,0,1,1,INST EASTERN EUROPEAN RESEARCH & CONSULTING,KHARKIV,"EDUC CAMPUS KNAU, KHARKIV, UKRAINE",,2414-584X,,AGR RESOUR EC INT SC,Agric.

Adaptation to climate variation therefore requires stability in grain quality as well as yield. Grain yield and quality of four modem rice varieties were shown to respond differently to the climatic condition of the wet, cool and hot season at Chiang Mai, Thailand. The variation in grain yield was associated with differential effects of season on grain filling in different varieties. A simple dilution effect on nutritional quality was indicated by inverse relation between grain yield and the concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus, iron and zinc in the endosperm, i.e. the white rice normally consumed by rice eaters. The rice varieties also showed differential response to season in their head rice yield, grain chalkiness and gelatinization temperature, independently of the grain yield. The relationship between head rice yield and grain chalkiness was not significant, although some complex physico-chemistry of the starch was suggested by the correlation between grain chalkiness and gelatinization temperature. The effects of variety and season found here suggested that evaluation of rice genotypes for adaptation to climate change will need to consider grain quality along with grain yield.","[Laenoi, Suwannee; Prom-u-Thai, Chanakan] Chiang Mai Univ, Agron Div, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Fac Agr, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Rerkasem, Benjavan] Chiang Mai Univ, Plant Genet Resources & Nutr Lab, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Lordkaew, Sittichai] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Agr, Ctr Agr Resource Syst Res, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Prom-u-Thai, Chanakan] Chiang Mai Univ, Lanna Rice Res Ctr, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand",Chiang Mai University; Chiang Mai University; Chiang Mai University; Chiang Mai University,"Prom-u-Thai, C (corresponding author), Chiang Mai Univ, Agron Div, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Fac Agr, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.",chanakan15@hotmail.com,,"Prom-u-thai, Chanakan/0000-0001-7167-5150",Office of the Higher Education Commission under National Research University project,Office of the Higher Education Commission under National Research University project,This study received financial support from the Office of the Higher Education Commission under National Research University project.,,48,19,19,5,89,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-4290,1872-6852,,FIELD CROP RES,Field Crop.

The development of practical climate change adaptation for environmental sustainability at regional and local scales is predicated on a strong understanding of future socio-economic dynamics under a range of potential climate projections. We have addressed this need using integrated assessment of a localized hybrid Shared Socioeconomic Pathway Representative Concentration Pathway (SSP-RCP) framework, through an interdisciplinary and participatory storyline development process that integrates bottom-up local expert-stakeholder knowledge with top down insights from global SSPs. We use the global SSPs (SSP1 to SSP5) as boundary conditions in conjunction with climate change pathways (RCP4.5, RCP8.5) to create localized SSP narratives in an iterative participatory process, using a storytelling method. By using an integrated socio-economic and environmental system dynamics model developed in collaboration with local stakeholders, we explore the potential impacts of plausible local SSP-RCP narratives and quantify important socio-environmental vulnerabilities of a human-water system (e.g., crop yields, farm income, water security and groundwater depletion) by the mid-century period (i.e., by 2050). The framework is developed to inform climate adaptation for Pakistan's Rechna Doab region, which serves as a representative case of a multi stakeholder coupled human-water system operating in a developing country. Our results suggest that even under limited socio-economic improvements (e.g., technology, policies, institutions, environmental awareness) water security would be expected to decline and environmental degradation (e.g., groundwater depletion) to worsen.

Aiming at a more nuanced gender analysis, this study examines how husbands and wives within the same household perceive climate risks and use group-based approaches as coping strategies. The data stem from a unique intra-household survey involving 156 couples in rural Kenya. The findings indicate that options for adapting to climate change closely interplay with husbands' and wives' roles and responsibilities, social norms, risk perceptions and access to resources. A higher percentage of wives were found to adopt crop-related strategies, whereas husbands employ livestock- and agroforestry-related strategies. Besides, there are gender-specific climate information needs, trust in information and preferred channels of information dissemination. Further, it turned out that group-based approaches benefit husbands and wives differently. Policy interventions that rely on group-based approaches should reflect the gender reality on the ground in order to amplify men's and women's specific abilities to manage risks and improve well-being outcomes in the face of accelerating climate change.

Nowadays, this domain is characterized by a complex constellation of different products, services, and actors. Indeed, the definitions of climate services adopted by the WMO and the European Union are very vague, leading to possible mismatches between users' expectations and producers' offers in terms of services. Consequently, several authors and institutions have adopted different terminologies. For example, Weichselgartner and Arheimer (2019) argue for climate adaptation products, climate adaptation services and climate adaptation knowledge-action systems. Therefore, this article will pursue two goals: first, we will apply new terminologies to climate services across the European Union; secondly, we will investigate the possible correlation between the degree of decentralisation, the policymaking traditions (statist or corporatist), and the emergence of climate adaptation knowledge-action systems in selected countries (EU 27). From our analysis we conclude that climate change adaptation knowledge action systems were most developed in corporatist and/or decentralized countries such as Austria, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, and Spain. At the same time, statist and centralized countries show different degrees of integration of climate products and services in their adaptation governance: some developed adaptation services (France), for others no product or service was found (Greece). We believe that better use of terminology (e.g., product vs service) is an important step for the development of climate services and a sign of increasing maturity in the field.","[Panenko, Anastasia] Univ Grenoble Alpes, PACTE, INRAE, LESSEM, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [George, Emmanuelle] Univ Grenoble Alpes, LESSEM, INRAE, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Lutoff, Celine] Univ Grenoble Alpes, PACTE, F-38000 Grenoble, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); INRAE; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); INRAE; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Panenko, A (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, PACTE, INRAE, LESSEM, F-38000 Grenoble, France.",anastasia.panenko@umrpacte.fr,,,French National Research Agency through the Investissements d'avenir program [ANR-15-IDEX-02],French National Research Agency through the Investissements d'avenir program(French National Research Agency (ANR)),This work was supported by the French National Research Agency through the Investissements d'avenir program (ANR-15-IDEX-02) within the CDP-Trajectories project.,,65,1,1,3,8,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8807,,,CLIM SERV,Clim.

This study uses the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework to investigate how indigenous communities living on two physically different islands in Torres Strait, Australia, experience what they consider to be the impacts of climate change in relation to their daily lives. During this process, a series of natural, physical, and socio-cultural limits and barriers to climate change adaptation were identified on Boigu, a low-lying mud island inundated by the sea during high tides and storm surges. As a volcanic island, Erub's elevation is higher but significant community infrastructure, housing, and cultural sites are located on the low coastal fringe. No immediate limits to climate change adaptation were identified on Erub, but physical and socio-cultural barriers were revealed. Limits to climate change adaptation occur when adaptation actions fail to protect the things valued by those affected, or few adaptation options are available. Barriers to climate change adaptation may be overcome if recognised and addressed but can become entrenched limits if they are ignored. Within the participating communities, such limits and barriers included (a) restricted adaptation options due to limited access to particular livelihood assets; (b) difficulty engaging with government processes to secure external support; and (c) people's place-based values, which evoke a reluctance to relocate or retreat.","[McNamara, Karen E.; Westoby, Ross] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Smithers, Scott G.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland; James Cook University,"McNamara, KE (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",karen.mcnamara@uq.edu.au,"Westoby, Ross/G-8895-2019; McNamara, Karen/D-7322-2013","Westoby, Ross/0000-0001-9868-2246; Smithers, Scott/0000-0002-4420-1897; McNamara, Karen/0000-0002-4511-8403",National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility,National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility,"We are grateful to the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility for supporting and funding this project.

To date, most climate adaptation guidance has focused on recommendations for frequent-fire forests, leaving few published guidelines for forests that naturally experience infrequent, stand-replacing wildfires. Because most such forests are inherently resilient to stand-replacing disturbances, and burn severity mosaics are largely indifferent to manipulations of stand structure (i.e., weather-driven, rather than fuel-driven fire regimes), we posit that pre-fire climate adaptation options are generally fewer in these regimes relative to others. Outside of areas of high human value, stand-scale fuel treatments commonly emphasized for other forest types would undermine many of the functions, ecosystem services, and other values for which these forests are known. For stand-replacing disturbance regimes, we propose that (1) managed wildfire use (e.g., allowing natural fires to burn under moderate conditions) can be a useful strategy as in other forest types, but likely confers fewer benefits to long-term forest resilience and climate adaptation, while carrying greater socio-ecological risks; (2) reasoned fire exclusion (i.e., the suppression component of a managed wildfire program) can be an appropriate strategy to maintain certain ecosystem conditions and services in the face of change, being more ecologically justifiable in long-interval fire regimes and producing fewer of the negative consequences than in frequent-fire regimes; (3) low-risk pre-disturbance adaptation options are few, but the most promising approaches emphasize fundamental conservation biology principles to create a safe operating space for the system to respond to change (e.g., maintaining heterogeneity across scales and minimizing stressors); and (4) post-disturbance conditions are the primary opportunity to implement adaptation strategies (such as protecting live tree legacies and testing new regeneration methods), providing crucial learning opportunities. This approach will provide greater context and understanding of these systems for ecologists and resource managers, stimulate future development of adaptation strategies, and illustrate why public expectations for climate adaptation in these forests will differ from those for frequent-fire forests.","[Halofsky, Joshua S.; Donato, Daniel C.] Washington State Dept Nat Resources, 1111 Washington St SE,Box 47014, Olympia, WA 98504 USA; [Donato, Daniel C.; Franklin, Jerry F.; Halofsky, Jessica E.; Harvey, Brian J.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, POB 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Peterson, David L.] US Forest Serv, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, 400 N 34th St, Seattle, WA 98103 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Halofsky, JS (corresponding author), Washington State Dept Nat Resources, 1111 Washington St SE,Box 47014, Olympia, WA 98504 USA.",joshua.halofsky@dnr.wa.gov,"Harvey, Brian J/T-9513-2017; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Harvey, Brian J/0000-0002-5902-4862; ",,,,,96,29,30,7,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,MAR,2018,9,3,,,,,,,e02140,10.1002/ecs2.2140,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2140,,,18,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1JO,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000428071900015,View Full Record in Web of Science

With failing mitigation policies and instruments, the urgency of adaptation to climate change is increasing. Assessment of regional consequences of climate change includes the perceptions and motivations of presumed losers or winners. New security implications related to climate change are emerging in the Arctic, South-East Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. Energy supply security is a dominant factor in geopolitical considerations. The geopolitics of climate change is inextricably linked to many other issues of globalization.

To derive lessons for climate change adaptation, this paper evaluates the results gained after five years of an integrated river basin management (IRBM) programme in the Conchos River in northern Mexico. Autonomous adaptation measures assessed include: modernization of irrigation practices; pilot sustainable watershed management projects in the upper basin; development of an environmental flow assessment and a proposal to improve water allocation; and the creation of the Inter-institutional Working Group as a basin organization. These measures have improved river basin management, yet adverse outcomes were also observed, such as impacts of surface water efficiency measures that were not managed in conjunction with groundwater. Key adaptation lessons derived include: the importance of multi-stakeholder participation in designing and implementing adaptive management measures; the need for significant investment in transfer of expertise and capacity building; and the positive effect of linking local, national and international institutions. These results highlight the need for more investment in 'soft' adaptive management in place of infrastructure. In the Rio Conchos, if these no regrets' adaptation measures are consolidated in the following years, they will serve as a foundation to develop planned and more effective climate change adaptation programmes, and enhance institutional, environmental and societal resilience.","[Eugenio Barrios, J.] WWF Mexico, River Basin Management Program, Mexico City 06100, DF, Mexico; [Alfredo Rodriguez-Pineda, J.] WWF Mexico, River Basin Management Program, Col Ctr, Chihuahua 31000, Chih, Mexico; [de la Maza Benignos, Mauricio] WWF Chihuahuan Desert Program, Chihuahua 31000, Chih, Mexico",,"Barrios, JE (corresponding author), WWF Mexico, River Basin Management Program, Ave Mexico 51, Mexico City 06100, DF, Mexico.",ebarrios@wwfmex.org,,,,,,,36,11,11,3,32,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Multistage sampling procedure was used in the selection of 288 respondents. To account for selection bias due to both observable and unobservable factors where more than two options arise, the multinomial endogenous switching regression model was used to analyze the collected data. The empirical findings revealed that level of education brought about increase in the probability of adopting bore-hole construction, stocking time adjustment and embankment creation as adaptation strategies to climate change. Also, adoption of stocking time adjustment and embankment creation by the adopters increased food security index by 106.1 and 16.9%, respectively. Furthermore, adoption of stocking time adjustment in the adopters' category reduced the poverty gap by 87.2%. It is, therefore, recommended that policies which promote adoption of climate change adaptation strategies (especially stocking time adjustment and bore-hole construction being the strategies with the highest impact) should be formulated since they are capable of increasing welfare of aquaculture fish farmers.","[Oparinde, Lawrence Olusola] Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, PMB 704, Akure, Nigeria",,"Oparinde, LO (corresponding author), Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, PMB 704, Akure, Nigeria.",looparinde@futa.edu.ng,"Oparinde, Lawrence/AEK-7634-2022","Oparinde, Lawrence/0000-0001-7262-091X",,,,,48,3,3,2,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

The three pathways are bottom-up projections of local biophysical and socioeconomic conditions, and they are consistent to downscaled regional climate scenarios. Results show that changes in agricultural land uses under future climate change and representative agricultural pathways are substantially different, compared with results not considering representative agricultural pathways. This finding suggests that climate change impacts and adaptation may be underestimated or overestimated if future biophysical and socioeconomic developments are not incorporated, particularly in regional agricultural assessments of climate change adaptation. One implication from this analysis for global adaptation strategies is the need for future infrastructure supports to maintain a climate-resilient agricultural production system due to changes in agricultural land uses.","[Mu, Jianhong E.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 78440 USA; [Antle, John M.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA; [Abatzoglou, John T.] Univ Idaho, Dept Geog, Moscow, ID 83844 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Oregon State University; Idaho; University of Idaho,"Mu, JE (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 78440 USA.",mujh@tamu.edu; john.antle@oregonstate.edu; jabatzoglou@uidaho.edu,"Abatzoglou, John T/ABE-6134-2020; Abatzoglou, John T/C-7635-2012","Abatzoglou, John T/0000-0001-7599-9750; Abatzoglou, John T/0000-0001-7599-9750",United States Geological Survey [G14AC00243]; USDA-NIFA [2011-68002-30191],United States Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey); USDA-NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),The project described in this publication was supported partly by the Grant/Cooperative Agreement Number G14AC00243 from the United States Geological Survey and partly by USDA-NIFA award no. 2011-68002-30191.

This is further complicated by the abstract and ambiguous terms, such as vulnerability and adaptive capacity, employed in the literature and the inadequate consideration given to the wider array of social science methods that are being applied now that adaptation has become a practical necessity. To address these limitations, a review and novel classification of vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation methods is presented. Methods are classified based on goals addressed, thematic clusters of variables involved, and underlying theoretical assumptions. On the top-level, methods are distinguished into impact analysis, behavior analysis, institutional analysis, and decision analysis methods. The first three branches are further classified according to descriptive, explanatory, and predictive goals, as well as theoretical assumptions. For each type, empirical conditions of applicability and examples from the literature are presented. While this classification can only be partial due to the ever growing methodological diversity in the field of climate change adaptation, we provide a more rigorous basis for the coherent exchange of methodological arguments and thereby hope to foster the interdisciplinary dialog needed to advance the field.

Given the crucial role of local governments in building societywide adaptive capacity, understanding how municipalities understand and interpret CCA is important. In this study, we analyze 12 large-scale questionnaires from 2007 to 2020 distributed to all Norwegian municipalities. Using a combination of directed and conventional content analysis of the questions and answers, we summarize and map the progress of adaptation work over the 14 years and assess the consistency and the scope of the surveys in light of the current research on climate adaptation. We find diverging views on what adaptation entails, both from the researchers, in the phrasing of questions, and from the respondents. The empirical evidence suggests an overall imbalanced interpretation of CCA, in terms of the risks and consequences we may face, the climate to which adapting is needed, and adequate adaptation strategies. We go on to discuss the implications of these findings, highlighting the need for a shared and well-communicated framework for local CCA and a closer monitoring of the actual efforts of the municipalities. If instead left unchecked, this confusion might lead to unsustainable maladaptation at the local government level throughout Norway and beyond.","[Selseng, Torbjorn; Rusdal, Tone] Western Norway Res Inst, Sogndal, Norway; [Klemetsen, Marit] Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res, Oslo, Norway",,"Selseng, T (corresponding author), Western Norway Res Inst, Sogndal, Norway.",tse@vestforsk.no,,"Rusdal, Tone/0000-0003-4691-3078",Research Council of Norway [299801],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),The work was supported by the Research Council of Norway under Grant 299801.

Therefore, it becomes important to assess vulnerability and adaptation measures to raise awareness and monitoring of climate change adaptation policy for better decision-making. This research examines how farmers perceive their vulnerability and how they respond to climate change in the semi-arid Far North Region of Cameroon. Using both quantitative and qualitative approaches, data on perceptions with regards to vulnerability and adaptation responses to climate change related hazards were collected based on expert opinions, individual farmers' interviews, and focus group discussion. The qualitative data were triangulated with direct observations in the field. The results reveal that farmers are mostly concerned about drought and decrease in rainfall. Thus, they have mainly implemented behavioral and locally-made options such as short-cycle varieties, terrace farming, half-moon, and bunds, among others, to overcome water shortages. Nevertheless, these measures were not solely driven by vulnerability; the socioeconomic context might play a role. Moreover, farmers perceive a limited capacity to adapt to climate change, which suggests that the government and policy-makers should focus, not only on implementing planned adaptation strategies, but also on the improvement and promotion of farmers' autonomous adaptation strategies.","[Njoya, Hamza Moluh; Matavel, Custodio Efraim; Msangi, Haji Athumani; Loehr, Katharina; Sieber, Stefan] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Sustainable Land Use Developing Countries, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Njoya, Hamza Moluh; Matavel, Custodio Efraim; Sieber, Stefan] Humboldt Univ, Fac Life Sci, Dept Agr Econ, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Njoya, Hamza Moluh; Wouapi, Herve Alain Napi] Univ Dschang, Fac Agron & Agr Sci, Dept Rural Socioecon & Agr Extens SERVA, Dschang 222, Cameroon; [Matavel, Custodio Efraim] Univ Lurio, Fac Agr Sci, Unango Campus, Sanga, Niassa, Mozambique; [Msangi, Haji Athumani] Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Morogoro 67125, Tanzania; [Loehr, Katharina] Humboldt Univ, Urban Plant Ecophysiol, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); Humboldt University of Berlin; Sokoine University of Agriculture; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Njoya, HM (corresponding author), Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Sustainable Land Use Developing Countries, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany.;Njoya, HM (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Fac Life Sci, Dept Agr Econ, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.;Njoya, HM (corresponding author), Univ Dschang, Fac Agron & Agr Sci, Dept Rural Socioecon & Agr Extens SERVA, Dschang 222, Cameroon.",Hamza.Moluh-Njoya@zalf.de,"Matavel, Custodio Efraim/AAX-1675-2021","Matavel, Custodio Efraim/0000-0002-3800-7887; Sieber, Stefan/0000-0002-4849-7277","Projekt DEAL; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, under the International Climate Protection Fellowship Program 2021-2022 (ICP-AvH)","Projekt DEAL; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, under the International Climate Protection Fellowship Program 2021-2022 (ICP-AvH)(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation)","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

Making adaptation decisions is difficult in the light of uncertainties and the complexity of adaptation problems. Already large amounts of research results on climate impacts and adaptive measures are available, and more are produced and need to be mediated across the boundary between science and policy. Both researchers and policy-makers have started to intensify efforts to coproduce knowledge that is valuable to both communities, particularly in the context of climate change adaptation. In this paper, we present results from a study of adaptation governance and information needs, comparing eight European countries. We identify sources and means for the retrieval of information as well as gaps and problems with the knowledge provided by scientists and analyzed whether these appear to be contingent on the point in the policy-making cycle where countries are. We find that in this early phase of adaptation planning, the quality of the definition of needs, the way uncertainty is dealt with, and the quality of science-policy interaction are indeed contingent on the stage of adaptation planning, while information needs and sources are not. We conclude that a well-developed science-policy interface is of key importance for effective decision-making for adaptation.","[Hanger, Susanne; Pfenninger, Stefan; Patt, Anthony] IIASA, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Dreyfus, Magali] UNU, IAS, Int Org Ctr Pacifico Yokohama, Nishi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2208502, Japan",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); United Nations University,"Hanger, S (corresponding author), IIASA, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",hanger@iiasa.ac.at,"Patt, Anthony/E-5437-2017","Pfenninger, Stefan/0000-0002-8420-9498; Hanger, Susanne/0000-0001-7223-9991",European Union; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [10F00810] Funding Source: KAKEN,"European Union(European Commission); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was funded by the European Union Seventh Framework Program through the project Methodology for Effective Decision-making on Impacts and AdaptaTION (MEDIATION) coordinated by Prof. Rob Swart at the University of Wageningen.

The term 'climate change resilience,' frequently used to characterize adaptation strategies, deserves closer scrutiny because it is ambiguous, often misunderstood, and difficult to apply consistently across disciplines and spatial and temporal scales to support conservation efforts. Current definitions of resilience encompass all aspects of adaptation from resisting and absorbing change to reorganizing and transforming in response to climate change. However, many stakeholders are unfamiliar with this spectrum of definitions and assume the more common meaning of returning to a previous state after a disturbance. Climate change, however, is unrelenting and intensifying, characterized by both directional shifts in baseline conditions and increasing variability in extreme events. This ongoing change means that scientific understanding and management responses must develop concurrently, iteratively, and collaboratively, in a science-management partnership. Divergent concepts of climate change resilience impede cross-jurisdictional adaptation efforts and complicate use of adaptive management frameworks. Climate change adaptation practitioners require clear terminology to articulate management strategies and the inherent tradeoffs involved in adaptation. Language that distinguishes among strategies that seek to resist change, accommodate change, and direct change (i.e., persistence, autonomous change, and directed change) is prerequisite to clear communication about climate change adaptation goals and management intentions in conservation areas.","[Fisichelli, Nicholas A.; Schuurman, Gregor W.; Hoffman, Cat Hawkins] Natl Pk Serv, Nat Resource Stewardship & Sci, Ft Collins, CO USA",United States Department of the Interior,"Fisichelli, NA (corresponding author), Natl Pk Serv, Nat Resource Stewardship & Sci, Ft Collins, CO USA.",nicholas_fisichelli@nps.gov,,,,,,,44,51,51,1,44,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0364-152X,1432-1009,,ENVIRON MANAGE,Environ.

Climate change adaptation is needed to address structural failures and safety concerns. Despite recognizing the need for support from stakeholders and adaptation of infrastructure, the level of adaptation activity remains limited and inconsistent across regions and communities in rural Alaska. We address this need by identifying barriers to community-wide adaptation of infrastructure based on stakeholder perspectives who make adaptation decisions for government agencies, nonprofits, engineering firms, or academic institutions in rural Alaska. Barriers were identified qualitatively through interviews (N = 25) and validated quantitatively through surveys (N = 30). Qualitative and quantitative results identified and validated 17 barriers to adaptation of infrastructure - spanning sociocultural, institutional, economic, physical, and environmental dimensions based on the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF). Results demonstrate the need for national adaptation funding and policy that is specific to the diverse cultural landscapes, extreme weather, rural locations, limited transportation, and high costs in rural Alaska. Adaptation funding and policy is needed that supports the collaboration of Alaska-based institutions, such as nonprofit organizations and engineering firms, Tribal entities, and rural Alaska community representatives in adaptation.","[Taylor, Jessica E.; Poleacovschi, Cristina] Iowa State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Perez, Michael] Auburn Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Iowa State University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Taylor, JE (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",jessicataylor8910@gmail.com,,,National Science Foundation [928105],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This material is based in part on work supported by the National Science Foundation [#928105].,,69,0,0,4,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

There is also very little understanding and consensus on how and to what extent local communities can and should be involved in these projects. Arguably, both the concept and practice of community participation remain equivocal and contentious due to a lack of systematic effort to define the participatory framework in CCA. While the framework for community participation can be adopted from other planning and management discourses, yet they are typically expert-driven. The local communities hardly play a role in designing the framework. This study, therefore, took an alternative approach to define the meaning and implication of community participation from local communities' perspectives. To this end, we used the grounded theory qualitative research methods to survey 50 respondents across five rural communities in climate change impacted Northern Ghana. To evaluate the communities' meaningful participation in the adaptation projects, respondents suggested three critical parameters-First, community participation in a CCA project can be considered successful if the project contributes towards the livelihood security of the community. Second, the project outcome should be tangible. Third, the project should enhance the community's skills and training such that the community can run a similar project in the future without much dependence on external agencies. This study provides an alternative methodological insight on how to design and operationalize meaningful community participation in CCA that will have universal application irrespective of the geographical and socio-cultural boundaries.","[Samaddar, Subhajyoti; Yokomatsu, Muneta] Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst DPRI, Kyoto, Japan; [Oteng-Ababio, Martin] Univ Ghana, Dept Geog & Resource Dev, Accra, Ghana; [Dayour, Frederick; Obeng, Francis K.; Ziem, Romanus] Univ Dev Studies, Tamale, Ghana; [Ayaribila, Akudugu] Univ Energy & Nat Resources Sunyani, Sunyani, Ghana",Kyoto University; University of Ghana; University for Development Studies,"Samaddar, S (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst DPRI, Kyoto, Japan.",samaddar@imdr.dpri.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Science Technology Agency (JST); Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), SATREPS (Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development)","Japan Science Technology Agency (JST)(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)); Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), SATREPS (Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development)",This research was carried out by the Enhancing Resilience to 'Climate and Ecosystem Changes in Semi-arid Africa: An Integrated Approach' with financial support from the Japan Science Technology Agency (JST) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) as part of SATREPS (Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development).

The present study investigated cotton farmers' climate change adaptation and its impact on increasing cotton productivity and net cotton income in Punjab province of Pakistan. A pretested and well-structured questionnaire was used for data collection of 480 cotton farmers from three major cotton-producing divisions of cotton-wheat zone of Punjab, Pakistan. Logistic regression analysis approach was used in this study to find out the factors of adaptation and propensity score matching method employed to identify connecting adaptation impact on cotton productivity and cotton income. Empirical estimates of this study indicated as owing to some external and internal constraint farmers were limited focused on adaptation while conscious about adverse effects of climate change. Usage of required and recommended types of fertilizer, variation in planting dates, and changing varieties of crop were main adaptation strategies implemented by cotton farmers. Cotton farmers' adaptation decision was significantly influenced by some major factors as weather forecasting, market information, easy access to agricultural extension services, farming experience, and education of cotton farmer. Farm-level increase in cotton productivity and net cotton crop income was direct while overall increases in national output and improving rural area farmer well-being were indirect and significant outcomes of implementing climate change adaptation of cotton farmers. Cotton farmers were using various combinations of adaptation strategies and achieving more benefits regarding their crop productivity and net returns. Findings of the study suggest need for larger investment in farm-level extension services, farmers' schooling, and develop climate change institutional setup for enhancing farmers' adaptation capability to increasing cotton productivity, improving well-being of farming community, and securing agriculture from future climatic uncertainties. Future policies must deal with farm-level limitations of advanced adaptation measures like making available information and sustaining sponsoring soil conservation practices, launching climate smart varieties and advanced adaptation measures based on various agro-ecological zones.","[Ahmad, Dilshad] COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Management Sci, Vehari Campus, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Afzal, Muhammad] Preston Univ, Dept Econ, Islamabad, Pakistan",COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI),"Ahmad, D (corresponding author), COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Management Sci, Vehari Campus, Islamabad, Pakistan.",dilshad@ciitvehari.edu.pk; profafzal@gmail.com,,,,,,,55,16,16,6,27,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

Effectively mainstreaming climate change in city plans and operations and moving from ambition to implementation is complex. Multi-actor engagement, transdisciplinary knowledge interactions, co-designing and sustained co-learning are often required in such planning and action contexts. In this paper, we trace and reflect on the process of developing an adaptation planning process for the City of Johannesburg, South Africa. Given shortcomings of the previous adaptation responses attempted in the City, specifically that of poor uptake, we trialled a more intentional and directly designed, formative and interventionist approach using Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT). We reflect on what we as a research team and City officials learnt in this process. Our findings emphasise that exploring the local context remains critical in understanding and surfacing tensions with potential climate change responses. Failure to be mindful of such issues will likely result in mere compliance, and potentially, maladaptation. Contrary to experiences in other South African settings, rather than attempting to engage all actors simultaneously, our experience suggests that working with a core group initially, before expanding the circle of actors, is needed. These actors serve as mediators and pivotal actors for learning and change, and, with appropriate authority and passion, can drive, coalesce, and potentially re-enthuse waning interest from within. They leverage already existing trust relationships and strengthen participation throughout the process. Combined, these factors are critical for ensuring implementation and legacy. Significance: Careful attention to a co-designed and emergent 'Theory of Change' can help both the process and design of engaged climate change research and help to reframe the climate action needed in urban contexts. The collaborative processes we applied increased awareness and engagement between officials around issues of climate change and, in particular, climate change adaptation. The lessons and opportunities gathered in the miniature expansive learning journey we trialled may be useful for others trying to embark on climate change adaptation journeys in cities in Africa and beyond.","[Vogel, Coleen] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Vogel, Coleen; Coetzer, Kaera] Univ Witwatersrand, Global Change Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Mukute, Mutizwa] Rhodes Univ, Dept Educ, Environm Learning Res Ctr, Makhanda, South Africa; [Gwata, Mzukisi] Environm Infrastruct & Serv Dept, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand; University of Witwatersrand; Rhodes University,"Coetzer, K (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Global Change Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa.",klcoetzer@gmail.com,,,City of Johannesburg,City of Johannesburg,City of Johannesburg,,55,2,2,0,8,ACAD SCIENCE SOUTH AFRICA A S S AF,LYNWOOD RIDGE,"PO BOX 72135, LYNWOOD RIDGE 0040, SOUTH AFRICA",0038-2353,1996-7489,,S AFR J SCI,S.

Regions with complex, knowledge-intensive farming practices have many components that can be adjusted to increase systemic resilience. An argument for the importance of evolutionary adaptation pathways is developed with a case-study of the viticultural region of the McLaren Vale in South Australia. In a series of walk-and-talk interviews, farmers describe their business risks and the opportunities to adapt. Their responses suggest a sophisticated ecological understanding facilitated by their life-experiences, learning networks and relationships with governance, research and marketing organisations. In particular, a new exploitation of agrobiodiversity is generating on-farm resilience by spreading the risks of production and providing opportunities for the region to better respond to changing environmental and market conditions. Individual farmers have developed unique climate change adaptation pathways, but effective cooperation has also enabled the evolution of a regional adaptation cluster. Regions such as the McLaren Vale with a path dependence of innovation could have a cultural heritage that supports attempts at adaptation, which will in turn make them vital first-movers in the search for effective responses to climate change risk.","[Bardsley, Douglas K.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Social Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Palazzo, Elisa] Univ New South Wales, UNSW Built Environm, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Bardsley, Douglas K.; Putz, Marco] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zurich, Switzerland","University of Adelaide; University of New South Wales Sydney; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research","Bardsley, DK (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Social Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",douglas.bardsley@adelaide.edu.au,"Pütz, Marco/B-8389-2016; palazzo, elisa/AAM-5061-2020","Pütz, Marco/0000-0001-7868-6864; palazzo, elisa/0000-0001-6189-8692","Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources within the Government of South Australia, Australia through their Wildlife Conservation Fund Grants Program [2014/15]","Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources within the Government of South Australia, Australia through their Wildlife Conservation Fund Grants Program","This work was supported by the Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources within the Government of South Australia, Australia through their Wildlife Conservation Fund Grants Program (Research) 2014/15.",,103,16,16,3,58,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0743-0167,1873-1392,,J RURAL STUD,J.

Therefore, understanding how rural smallholder farmers perceive climate change, climate variability, and factors that influence their choices would facilitate a better understanding of how these farmers adapt to the negative impacts of climate change. A Zero-inflated double hurdle model was employed to estimate the factors influencing farmers' adoption of adaptation strategies and intensity of adoption at the household level in South Africa. Different socioeconomic factors such as gender, age, and experience in crop farming, institutional factors like access to extension services, and access to climate change information significantly influenced the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies among beneficiaries of land reform in South Africa. Concerning intensity of adoption, age, educational level, farming experience, on-farm training, off-farm income, access to information through ICT and locational variables are the significant determinants of intensity of adaptation strategies. Thus, education attainment, non-farm employment, farming experience are significant incentives to enhance smallholder farmers' adaptive capacity through the adoption of many adaptation approaches. This study therefore concluded that farm-level policy efforts that aim to improve rural development should focus on farmers' education, on-farm demonstration and non-farm employment opportunities that seek to engage the farmers, particularly during the off-cropping season. The income from non-farm employment can be plough-back into farm operations such as the adoption of soil and water conservation, use of improved planting varieties, insurance, among others to mitigate climate variability and subsequently increase productivity. Policies and investment strategies of the government should be geared towards supporting education, providing on-farm demonstration trainings, and disseminating information about climate change adaptation strategies, particularly for smallholder farmers in the country. Thus, the government, stakeholders, and donor agencies must provide capacity-building innovations around the agricultural extension system and education on climate change using information and communication technologies.","[Thinda, K.

Adapting to climate change by hospital and community health services will entail responding to changing health needs of the local population, and to the likely effects of climate change on health service resources, workforce and infrastructure. In this paper we apply a model that health services can use to predict and respond to climate change risks and illustrate this with reference to Sydney's Local Health Districts (LHDs). We outline the climate change predictions for the Sydney metropolitan area, discuss the resulting vulnerabilities for LHDs and consider the potential of LHDs to respond. Three 'core business' categories are examined: (1) ambulance, emergency and acute health care; (2) routine health care; and (3) population and preventative health services. We consider the key climate change risks and vulnerabilities of the LHDs' workforce, facilities and finances, and some important transboundary issues. Many Australian health services have existing robust disaster plans and management networks. These could be expanded to incorporate local climate and health adaptation plans. What is known about the topic? There is an inextricable relationship between climate change and human health, with important implications for the delivery of health services. Climate change will affect health service demand, and the resources, workforce and infrastructure of health services. What does this paper add? This paper outlines how local health services can use existing data sources and models for assessing their climate change-related risks and vulnerabilities to predict, prepare for and respond to those risks. This is illustrated with reference to Sydney's LHDs. What are the implications for practitioners? Adaptation to climate change by health services is an important component of risk management.

Guyana, a developing country in South America, is highly susceptible to sea-level rise and flooding, because much of the population lives at or below sea level and depends upon old and decaying coastal infrastructure. This article examines the efforts of the Guyanese state to prioritize climate change adaptation, drawing from budgetary and documentary analyses and in-depth interviews with key informants in pertinent government ministries and non-governmental organizations. The Guyana government clearly recognizes the country's acute vulnerability to climate change - which has been accentuated by multiple recent flood events - and focuses on the need for vast infrastructural rehabilitation and enhancement as the main adaptation priority. However, while Guyana has emerged as a champion of climate change mitigation through averted deforestation, government investment in adaptation remains relatively small, and although a limited budget is one of the reasons for this, a number of other impediments complicate the issue. These include limited technical skills, low public awareness and the longer time-scale of threats relative to other national priorities. Ultimately, this case highlights some of the formidable challenges which poor countries face in prioritizing investments in adaptation.","[Hickey, Catherine; Weis, Tony] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Weis, T (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",aweis@uwo.ca,,,,,,,34,10,10,2,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Agriculture sector faces many challenges including climate change. Climate change causes low productivity in agriculture; low productivity is caused due to poor implementation of agricultural policies and strategies. This poor implementation of policies has also caused many farmers to be not competent in climate change adaptation. Over the years, provisions of agricultural advice and extension were provided by various approaches, including training and visit extension, participatory approaches, and farmers' field schools. However, provision of agricultural advisory and extension service is inefficient. Also, in most cases the usage of most agricultural innovations and technologies developed is limited. A literature review indicates that the main reasons given by Tanzanian farmers for not using improved technology are not lack of knowledge or skill, but rather that the technologies do not contribute towards improvements (e.g., the technologies are not profitable or they imply to high risk). Thus, agricultural extension service needs to be geared towards teaching farmers how to develop innovative and cost effective technologies that are contextualized. Limited numbers of agricultural extension staff and less interactivity of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), such as radio and television, have been mentioned to be among the factors limiting the provision of agricultural advisory and extension services to the majority of farmers in Tanzania. The advancements in ICTs have brought new opportunities for enhancing access to agricultural advisory and extension service for climate change adaptation. In Tanzania, farmers and other actors access agricultural information from various sources such as agricultural extension workers and use of various databases from Internet Services Providers. Also there are different web - and mobile - based farmers' advisory information systems to support conventional agricultural extension service. These systems are producing bulk amounts of data which makes it difficult for different stakeholders to make an informed decision after data analysis. This calls for the need to develop a tool for data visualization in order to understand hidden patterns from massive data. In this study, a semi-automated text classification was developed to determine the frequently asked keywords from a web and mobile based farmers' advisory system called UshauriKilimo after being in use for more than 2 years by more than 700 farmers.","[Tumbo, Siza D.] Ctr Agr Mechanizat & Rural Technol, Arusha, Tanzania; [Mwalukasa, Nicholaus; Fue, Kadeghe G.; Mlozi, Malongo R.

Climate change adaptation is now becoming a critical agenda item for cities. The potential for ecosystem-based climate adaptation using a green infrastructure approach is appealing for many cities but the business case for implementation has to be made more effectively. There is a substantial body of evidence that shows green infrastructure is significantly beneficial for human health and wellbeing and that it has many applications for climate adaptation. Despite this evidence, the linkage between green infrastructure benefits and improved health outcomes remains to be adequately quantified. There are limited studies from the international grey literature that indicate the potential and substantial economic health value of green infrastructure. Moreover, these studies use different methodological frameworks, making it difficult to systematically evaluate and compare the monetary estimates. The explicit lack of peer-reviewed studies specifically evaluating the economic health value of green infrastructure projects highlights the need for such work to be undertaken. Addressing these research gaps would assist to accelerate policy development to drive the implementation of green infrastructure and ecosystem-based climate adaptation outcomes to support sustainable urban development.","[Bowen, Kathryn J.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Populat Hlth, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Lynch, Yvonne] City Melbourne, Council House 2,240 Little Collins St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Australian National University,"Bowen, KJ (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Populat Hlth, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",kathrynjbowen@gmail.com,,"Bowen, Kathryn/0000-0002-2125-1963","Victorian Adaptation and Sustainability Partnership, Government of Victoria, Australia","Victorian Adaptation and Sustainability Partnership, Government of Victoria, Australia","This work was supported by the Victorian Adaptation and Sustainability Partnership, Government of Victoria, Australia.

Each of these groups uses specific interpretations of climate change and specifies how to deal with climate change impacts. We suggest that a deeper understanding and follow-up of the identified mental models might be useful for the design of any stakeholder involvement in future climate impact research processes.

A series of Shared Learning Dialogues supported by the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCCRN) involved staff from city government, NGOs and universities. This led to the formation of a multi-stakeholder City Team that was charged by the mayor with assessing climate risks and vulnerability, prioritizing problems and programmes, supporting small-scale adaptation projects and functioning as climate change adaptation advocates within the city. The paper describes some of these projects and how a range of factors underpinned better solid waste management and flood risk reduction, including fiscal reform that brought a large increase in the city's budget, strong leadership and better planning.

Floods in 2015 became a catalyst for a different way of 'doing' climate change adaptation suggesting more care-full and just intentions and practices. Drawing from both local authority and community actions, we document how care has become the basis for a meaningful way to bring justice to the forefront of the early stages of adaptation planning. We document how Tronto's (2013) caring with is demonstrated in a significant shift in the relationship between and within affected communities and the Council since the floods. The nature of this partnership work is evident through community initiatives and the Council's approach to community engagement, both of which are providing spaces in which adaptation discussions are becoming easier, the emotional dimensions of climate change impacts can be expressed, and where embodied care work is justice work.

Policies play an important role by providing the platform on which adaptation can occur and resilience be built. This study examines the policy environment in Vanuatu for its conduciveness to climate change adaptation. It identifies the types of adaptation processes (explicit or implicit) and types of adaptation measures (technical, business management, behavioural, policy, and research and education) and critically analyses the current tourism-related policies for their effectiveness in assisting the sector to address climate change. It is found that the majority of policies identified deal with climate change through implicit adaptation processes and mainly through the use of policy and research and education measures.

This article estimates the impact of climatic shocks on the household agricultural income and, subsequently, on farmers' adaptation strategies. Relying on data from a survey conducted in several communities in Bangladesh in 2011 and based on an IV probit approach, the results show that a 1 percentage point (pp) climate-induced decline in agricultural income pushes Bangladeshi households to adapt by almost 3 pp. Moreover, Bangladeshi farmers undertake a variety of adaptation options. However, several barriers to adaptation were identified, noticeably access to electricity and wealth. In this respect, policies can be implemented in order to assist the Bangladeshi farming community to adapt to climate change. Policy relevance This study contributes to the literature of adaptation to climate change by providing evidence of existing risk-coping strategies and by showing how a household's ability to adapt to weather-related risk can be limited.

Pakistan is one of the countries negatively affected by climate change due to its high exposure to extreme events and low adaptive capacity. In Pakistan, farmers are the primary stakeholders in agriculture and are more at risk due to climate vulnerability. Based on farm household data from 450 households collected from three districts in three agroecological zones in the Punjab province of Pakistan, this study examines how farmers perceive climate change and how they adapt their farming in response to perceived changes in climate. The results demonstrate that awareness of climate change is widespread throughout the area, and farm households make adjustments to adapt their agriculture in response to climatic change. Overall 58% of the farm households adapted their farming to climate change. Changing crop varieties, changing planting dates, planting of shade trees and changing fertilizers were the main adaptation methods implemented by farm households in the study area. The results from the binary logistic model reveal that education, farm experience, household size, land area, tenancy status, ownership of a tube well, access to market information, information on weather forecasting and agricultural extension services all influence farmers' choices of adaptation measures. The results also indicate that adaptation to climate change is constrained by several factors such as lack of information, lack of money, resource constraints and shortage of irrigation water in the study area. Findings of the study suggest the need for greater investment in farmer education and improved institutional setup for climate change adaptation to improve farmers' wellbeing.","[Abid, M.; Scheffran, J.] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Res Grp Climate Change & Secur, D-20144 Hamburg, Germany; [Abid, M.] Sch Integrated Climate Syst Sci, D-20144 Hamburg, Germany; [Schneider, U.

It then tests the impacts of workshops specifically designed to support disadvantaged young people's engagement with climate change adaptation which were rolled out with a designated Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) school in inner-city Dublin, Ireland. We found limited attention to public participation in climate change adaptation planning generally, with even less consideration given to engaging young people from disadvantaged communities. However, positive impacts with respect to enhanced knowledge of climate change science and policy processes emerged following participation in the workshops, providing the bedrock for a greater sense of self-efficacy around future engagement with climate action amongst the young people involved. We conclude that what is needed to help ensure procedural justice around climate action in Ireland are specific, relevant and interactive educational interventions on the issue of climate change adaptation; interventions which are sensitive to matters of place and difference.","[Davies, Anna R.; Hugel, Stephan] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Geog, Dublin 2, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Davies, AR (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Geog, Dublin 2, Ireland.",daviesa@tcd.ie; shugel@tcd.ie,"Davies, Anna/F-3812-2014","Davies, Anna/0000-0002-3045-8552; Hugel, Stephan/0000-0003-4379-2450","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [713567]; Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) [13/RC/2077, 16/SP/3804]",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant; Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)(Science Foundation Ireland),This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 713567 and the financial support of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) under Grant Number 13/RC/2077 and 16/SP/3804.

We therefore combined a literature review and map analysis of PAs of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and national systems of PAs and freshwater ecosystems. We found that seven national parks were created for water resources protection but were not designed for freshwater conservation (i.e., larger watersheds). High-value biodiversity sites have not been protected, and new local PAs were created due to water resource needs. We quantified 31 Ramsar sites and observed that PAs cover 12% of lakes, 31% of glacial lakes and 12% of the total stream length in the tropical Andes. Additionally, 120 watersheds (average area 631 km(2)) with glaciers and 40% of the total glacier surface area were covered by PAs. Future research into the role of PAs in ecosystem services provision and more detailed freshwater inventories within and around PAs, especially for those dependent on glacier runoff, will fill key knowledge gaps for freshwater conservation and climate change adaptation in the tropical Andes.","[Quenta-Herrera, Estefania] Univ Mayor San Andres, Inst Ecol, Unidad Calidad Ambiental, Calle 27 Cota Cota, La Paz, Bolivia; [Crespo-Perez, Veronica] Pontificia Univ Catolica Ecuador, Escuela Ciencias Biol, Museo Zool QCAZ I, Lab Limnol, Av 12 Octubre 1076 & Roca,Apartado 17-01-2184, Quito, Ecuador; [Mark, Bryan G.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Geog, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Gonzales, Ana Lia] AICCA, Proyecto Adaptac Impactos Cambio Climat Recursos, Consorcio Desarrollo Sostenible Ecorreg Andina CO, La Paz, Bolivia; [Kulonen, Aino] Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, Mt Res Initiat, Mittelstr 43, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",Universidad Mayor de San Andres; Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Ecuador; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Bern,"Quenta-Herrera, E (corresponding author), Univ Mayor San Andres, Inst Ecol, Unidad Calidad Ambiental, Calle 27 Cota Cota, La Paz, Bolivia.",estefaniaqh@gmail.com,"Mark, Bryan/AAD-6137-2022","Crespo-Perez, Veronica/0000-0002-8811-1965; Quenta, Estefania/0000-0002-2724-5804; Mark, Bryan/0000-0002-4500-7957",Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC),Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC),"Writing this review article was an activity of the Mentoring and Training Program in IPCC Processes for Early Career Mountain Researchers supported by theDY Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) within the programme of SDC contributions to the 6th Assessment Cycle of the IPCC, and organized by MRI, University of Zurich, Helvetas and ICIMOD.

This study focusses to explore the livelihood as well as the vulnerability status of the marine fishing spatial units in Sindhudurg Coastal and Marine Ecosystem (SCME) area, west coast of India. The focus was to develop a composite index, namely, Sustainable Fisheries Livelihood Index (SFLI) comprising five capitals, which acts as a tool to evaluate the livelihood status of the fishing communities and also a coastal vulnerability (Cumulative Vulnerability Index-CVI) framework from an earlier assessment was used. The livelihood and vulnerability indices were integrated to arrive at a decision-making matrix to identify and propose suitable interventions for appropriate climate adaptation strategies and achieving sustainable fisheries livelihood. In the present study, SCME was found to have a low SFLI value (0.36). Among the three taluks in SCME, Malvan taluk had comparatively higher SFLI (0.46) than Vengurla (0.34) and Devgad (0.29) taluks. Based on cumulative vulnerability indices, the majority of marine fishing spatial units (i.e. 58.3% after combining high and very high CVI ranges) in SCME were found to face severe vulnerability. These spatial units, plotted using CVI versus SFLI in the four quadrants of decision matrix, were analyzed for management interventions with strategies aimed at reducing the vulnerability and improve the adaptive capacity of fishing communities to achieve sustainable livelihoods. Spatial units in Quadrant IV were preferred to have focused climate change adaptation strategies to minimize vulnerability as well as to improve the fisheries livelihood sustainability by enhancing the access to livelihood capital assets. Spatial units in Quadrant I might serve as model units to demonstrate the vulnerability mitigation interventions to achieve stability and sustainability of livelihoods. Appropriate interventions for climate change adaptation such as diversification of fishing, selection of appropriate fishing gears, regulation of fishing effort, diversification of livelihoods and adoption of ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM) have been discussed.","[Jeevamani, J.

In a further step, we analysed the content of the urban climate change mitigation and adaptation plans available in a smaller sample of 32 Italian cities of 2007 Eurostat Urban Audit database (UA-3), looking at the single actions undertaken for addressing mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Results show the almost total absence of comprehensive and stand-alone urban climate change adaptation plans in Italy (except for two cities, Ancona and Bologna), whereas we found that in 61 out of 76 cities municipal civil protection plans are the instruments that deal with local emergencies associated to extreme weather events. On the other hand, 56 out of 76 urban climate change mitigation plans (i.e. Sustainable Energy Action Plans) are being developed in the framework of the Covenant of Mayors, which is a transnational network of local governments created by the European Union (EU) in 2012. The results obtained on the mitigation side point out that, in absence of a national law that imposes Italian cities to develop LCPs, transnational networks are an effective boost to voluntary commitment to reach EU climate and energy objectives.","[Pietrapertosa, Filomena; Salvia, Monica] Natl Res Council Italy CNR, Inst Methodol Environm Anal IMAA, I-85050 Tito, PZ, Italy; [De Gregorio Hurtado, Sonia] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Urban & Spatial Planning, Sch Architecture, Ave Juan de Herrera 4, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [D'Alonzo, Valentina; Geneletti, Davide] Univ Trento, Dept Civil Environm & Mech Engn, Via Mesiano 77, I-38123 Trento, Italy; [D'Alonzo, Valentina] Eurac Res, Inst Renewable Energy, Via A Volta 13-A, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Church, Jon Marco] Univ Reims, EA 2076 HABITER, BP 30,57 Rue Pierre Taittinger, F-51571 Reims, France; [Musco, Francesco] Univ IUAV Venice, Dept Design & Planning Complex Environm, Santa Croce 1957, I-30135 Venice, Italy; [Reckien, Diana] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Metodologie per l'Analisi Ambientale (IMAA-CNR); Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; University of Trento; European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano; Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne; IUAV University Venice; University of Twente,"Pietrapertosa, F (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Italy CNR, Inst Methodol Environm Anal IMAA, I-85050 Tito, PZ, Italy.",filomena.pietrapertosa@imaa.cnr.it; monica.salvia@imaa.cnr.it; sonia.degregorio@upm.es; valentina.dalonzo@unitn.it; jon-marco.church@univ-reims.fr; davide.geneletti@unitn.it; francesco.musco@iuav.it; d.reckien@utwente.nl,"Geneletti, Davide/AAH-5407-2019; Pietrapertosa, Filomena/ABF-9161-2020; Salvia, Monica/B-7549-2015; Pietrapertosa, Filomena/B-7555-2015; Church, Jon M/A-5833-2011; De+Gregorio+Hurtado, Sonia/AAT-3769-2020; Geneletti, Davide/D-5266-2014; Reckien, Diana/P-7348-2015","Geneletti, Davide/0000-0002-5528-3365; Salvia, Monica/0000-0001-8989-0377; Pietrapertosa, Filomena/0000-0001-6519-7105; Church, Jon M/0000-0003-0906-2710; De+Gregorio+Hurtado, Sonia/0000-0002-4654-5386; Geneletti, Davide/0000-0002-5528-3365; Reckien, Diana/0000-0002-1145-9509; D'Alonzo, Valentina/0000-0002-1569-3642",,,,,32,38,38,7,36,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-2751,1873-6084,,CITIES,Cities,AUG,2019,91,,,,,,93,105,,10.1016/j.cities.2018.11.009,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2018.11.009,,,13,Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Urban Studies,IG5JU,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000473840200012,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, evaluation of scenario planning for adaptation is lacking. In this paper we summarise a science-policy session held at the European Climate Change Adaptation Conference in May 2019, where practitioners explored the strengths and weaknesses of scenario planning for climate adaptation and identified modifications to enhance the method's utility. Eight case studies spanning three scenario planning types (problem-focused, actor-focused and reflexive-interventionist) from varied socio-cultural contexts were presented by the authors, followed by discussion amongst the 40 participants. Strengths focussed on opportunities provided by scenario planning for stakeholder participation, and raising their awareness about future risks, vulnerability and uncertainty. Participatory scenario planning was most useful for building stakeholder consensus at the local scale (e.g. communities, neighbourhoods) over shorter timeframes (e.g. 20 years). Weaknesses centred on the inability of scenarios to generate quantitative predictions and concrete adaptation solutions. This was partly attributed to practitioners' limited understanding of stakeholder politics and power dynamics, and the resulting lack of integration of scenario exercises within decision-making processes. Scenarios were also limited by being static, and participatory processes were resource-intensive. Suggested modifications were to develop iterative scenario planning embedded within decision-making cycles. Such 'transient scenarios' could absorb system feedbacks and updated information to prioritise adaptation responses, thus actively contributing to ongoing adaptation pathways. Applying monitoring, evaluating and learning would enable reflexive refinement of the method, adapting it to become an agile approach applicable to varied socio-cultural and political contexts.","[Butler, James R.

To adapt to climate changes, local governments need information on the rate of glacier area and volume losses and on current ice thickness. Remote sensing analyses of Coropuna glacier (Peru) delineate an acute glaciated area decline between 1955 and 2008. We tested how volume changes can be estimated with remote sensing and GIS techniques using digital elevation models derived from both topographic maps and satellite images. Ice thickness was measured in 2004 using a Ground Penetrating Radar coupled with a Ground Positioning System during a field expedition. It provided profiles of ice thickness on different slopes, orientations and altitudes. These were used to model the current glacier volume using Geographical Information System and statistical multiple regression techniques. The results revealed a significant glacier volume loss; however the uncertainty is higher than the measured volume loss. We also provided an estimate of the remaining volume.

However, there is more limited research on the practical experience and challenges of implementing adaptation. This article draws on the experience of 20 state, regional and local adaptation initiatives across a range of sectors, scales and locations in Australia, to identify the challenges faced by adaptation practitioners and decision-makers, and some emerging good practices. The review finds that many critical challenges to adaptation are common across the range of adaptation initiatives, and that there are significant interdependencies between these challenges. They should therefore be addressed in any significant adaptation initiative, at an early stage and as a related set of issues. The review also identifies potential national initiatives to enhance adaptation capabilities, and a number of policy issues beyond the jurisdiction of local stakeholders. These have been progressed as part of a broader agenda to support adaptation capability development within Australia, and to strengthen the linkages between adaptation practice, policy and research.","[Webb, R.

Agriculture 4.0, as the fourth evolution in the farming technology, puts forward four essential requirements: increasing productivity, allocating resources reasonably, adapting to climate change, and avoiding food waste. As advanced information systems and Internet technologies are adopted in Agriculture 4.0, enormous farming data, such as meteorological information, soil conditions, marketing demands, and land uses, can be collected, analyzed, and processed for assisting farmers in making appropriate decisions and obtaining higher profits. Therefore, agricultural decision support systems for Agriculture 4.0 has become a very attractive topic for the research community. The objective of this paper aims at exploring the upcoming challenges of employing agricultural decision support systems in Agriculture 4.0. Future researchers may improve the decision support systems by overcoming these detected challenges. In this paper, the systematic literature review technique is used to survey thirteen representative decision support systems, including their applications for agricultural mission planning, water resources management, climate change adaptation, and food waste control. Each decision support system is analyzed under a systematic manner. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted from the aspects of interoperability, scalability, accessibility, usability, etc. Based on the evaluation result, upcoming challenges are detected and summarized, suggesting the development trends and demonstrating potential improvements for future research.","[Zhai, Zhaoyu; Fernan Martinez, Jose; Beltran, Victoria; Lucas Martinez, Nestor] UPM, Dept Ingn Telemat & Elect DTE, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn & Sistemas Telecomunicac, C Nikola Tesla S-N, Madrid 28031, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; ETS de Ingenieria Sistemas de Telecomunicacion,"Zhai, ZY (corresponding author), UPM, Dept Ingn Telemat & Elect DTE, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn & Sistemas Telecomunicac, C Nikola Tesla S-N, Madrid 28031, Spain.",zhaoyu.zhai@upm.es,"Martínez, José-Fernán/F-7294-2016; Lucas Martínez, Néstor/M-5383-2015","Lucas Martínez, Néstor/0000-0003-3333-4077; ZHAI, ZHAOYU/0000-0003-2023-4894","AFARCLOUD European Project (Aggregate Farming in the Cloud) [783221-AFarCloud-H2020-ECSEL2017-2]; Electronic Components and Systems for European Leadership Joint Undertaking (ECSEL JU); China Scholarship Council (CSC); Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [PCI2018-092965]","AFARCLOUD European Project (Aggregate Farming in the Cloud); Electronic Components and Systems for European Leadership Joint Undertaking (ECSEL JU); China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council); Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness(Spanish Government)","The research leading to the presented results has been undertaken within the AFARCLOUD European Project (Aggregate Farming in the Cloud), under Grant Agreement No. 783221-AFarCloud-H2020-ECSEL2017-2, partially by the Electronic Components and Systems for European Leadership Joint Undertaking (ECSEL JU) and in part by the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (Ref: PCI2018-092965), and partially supported by the China Scholarship Council (CSC).",,85,148,154,36,175,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0168-1699,1872-7107,,COMPUT ELECTRON AGR,Comput.

The research used Talensi District as a case study to determine factors influencing farmers' adaptation response and the actual practices used to avert climate change impact. A total of 225 small-scale farmers were sampled for survey and 100 key informants were used in focus group discussions. Utilizing the logistic regression model, the study indicated that education, transportation, inputs cost and extension services were the factors with high tendency of undermining farmers' ability to adapt to climate change. In addition, Weighted Average Index used to measure weather extremes revealed that drought and temperature had the highest level of occurrence. Climate change adaptation practices assessed in the study showed that change in planting date, improved crops varieties and land rotation were the most preferred practices. The study concluded that farmers resilience could be enhanced if governments and concerned organizations intensify adaptation campaigns, increase access to weather information, and train farmers on adaptable practices including, timely planting and alternative sources of livelihood. In addition, intensifying government support for agriculture including input subsidies, and provision of irrigation facilities were also good interventions to improve climate change resilience.","[Fagariba, Clifford James; Baoro, Serge Kevin Gildas Soule] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Resources & Environm Engn, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Song, Shaoxian] Wuhan Univ Technol, Hubei Key Lab Mineral Resources Proc & Environm, Luoshi Rd 122, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology; Wuhan University of Technology,"Fagariba, CJ (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Resources & Environm Engn, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",cfagariba@yahoo.com,", 宋少先/AAM-4178-2020; fagariba, clifford james/E-4032-2016; Song, Shaoxian/AGX-4949-2022","fagariba, clifford james/0000-0002-1870-0617; ",,,,,50,9,9,1,4,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",2391-9531,,,OPEN AGRIC,Open Agric.,JAN,2018,3,1,,,,,524,536,,10.1515/opag-2018-0057,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/opag-2018-0057,,,13,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Agriculture,HL1IB,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000458449000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The research community is expected to contribute with innovative methods and tools to support to decision- and policy-makers. Decision Support Systems (DSSs), have a relatively long history in the water management sector. They are usually developed upon pre-existing hydrologic simulation models, providing interfaces for facilitated use beyond the limited group of model developers, and specific routines for decision making (e.g. optimization methods). In recent years, the traditional focus of DSS research has shifted away from the software component, towards the process of structuring problems and aiding decisions, thus including in particular robust methods for stakeholders' participation.

This article provides empirical insights into the perceived effects of separating government institutions for DRR and CCA within the Southern African Development Community member states. A mixed method research design was applied to the study. A total of 40 respondents from Botswana, Eswatini (until April 2018 Swaziland), Madagascar, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe participated in face-to-face interviews or an online survey. Five major effects of separating the organizations for DRR and CCA that impede efforts to reduce disaster risk coherently were identified: duplication of services, polarization of interventions, incoherent policies, competition for the same resources, and territorial contests. Given the continued fragmentation of institutions for DRR and CCA, highlighting these effects is important to emphasize the need for integrated approaches towards the reduction of disaster risk.","[Nemakonde, Livhuwani D.; Van Niekerk, Dewald; Becker, Per; Khoza, Sizwile] North West Univ, Unit Environm Sci & Management, African Ctr Disaster Studies, ZA-2522 Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Becker, Per] Lund Univ, Lund Univ Ctr Risk Assessment & Management LUCRAM, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",North West University - South Africa; Lund University,"Nemakonde, LD (corresponding author), North West Univ, Unit Environm Sci & Management, African Ctr Disaster Studies, ZA-2522 Potchefstroom, South Africa.",livhuwani.nemakonde@acds.co.za,"Nemakonde, Livhuwani/AAK-2946-2021","Becker, Per/0000-0001-9379-9461; Nemakonde, Livhuwani David/0000-0002-3458-5575",,,,,50,6,8,1,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2095-0055,2192-6395,,INT J DISAST RISK SC,Int.

The method was developed and tested in case studies in three different sectors in Sweden (the health sector, the tourism sector and water resource management). The result of the case studies is that the tailor-made scenario approach facilitated the engagement of the local planning body in climate change adaptation and helped them to analyse consequences and possible solutions in a structured way. However, the scenarios that emerged mainly focused on socioeconomic drivers on which the planning body had a large impact or drivers that can be influenced through cooperation with other actors at the local or regional level. While this result underlines the need for local stakeholder involvement in scenario processes, it also indicates a local bias that could be remedied by a stronger representation of national and global perspectives in the scenario development process. Finally, we discuss how a bottom-up approach could be combined with a consistency approach, which points towards a possible way forward to a hybrid methodology that is compatible with the scenario framework currently being developed in connection to the fifth assessment report of the IPCC.","[Carlsen, Henrik; Dreborg, Karl Henrik; Wikman-Svahn, Per] Swedish Def Res Agcy FOI, SE-16490 Stockholm, Sweden",FOI - Swedish Defence Research Agency,"Wikman-Svahn, P (corresponding author), Swedish Def Res Agcy FOI, SE-16490 Stockholm, Sweden.",per.wikman.svahn@foi.se,,"Carlsen, Henrik/0000-0003-1054-6747",Swedish Environmental Protection Agency,Swedish Environmental Protection Agency,The authors would like to thank all participants in the three case studies and especially the municipal civil servants that helped organise the studies.

When applied consistently, CG can become an emerging green practice with a positive impact on urban adaptation to climate change: CG may provide localized climate amelioration in ways that support social engagement outdoors. However, as spontaneous phenomena, CG should neither become an academic nor an aesthetic prescriptive tool. How then can CG be used as an active resource for urban adaptation to climate change while avoiding these two potential pitfalls? To explore this question, we present the concept of CG and the ways it can be situated in theoretical urbanism and analogous urban morphologies. We profile the CG inventory corpus and conceptualization that has taken place to date and expand them through a climate-responsive urban design lens. We then discuss how CG and climate-responsive urban design can be brought together while preventing the academization and aestheticizing of the former.

In order to accomplish this research objective, we have set out to present TEK examples on themes such as (1) local climate information, (2) understanding climate change, (3) coping with climate change and developing adaptation strategies, and (4) correct management and protection of natural resources. This paper uses the qualitative research design of ethnographic research. The data were collected using qualitative data collection methods such as observations and interviews between 2018-2021, with the data analysis using the descriptive analysis technique. The purposeful sampling method of convenience sampling was used to select the places to be observed and the study group. This paper reveals the local communities to have developed TEK practices and strategies against climate change and the problems that arise as a result in Turkey. Integrating these TEK examples with scientific knowledge in Turkey is believed to be able to play an important role in climate change adaptation and mitigation.","[Gul, Seyfullah] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Fac Educ, Samsun, Turkey",Ondokuz Mayis University,"Gul, S (corresponding author), Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Fac Educ, Samsun, Turkey.",seyfullah.gul@omu.edu.tr,,,,,,,46,0,0,2,2,"ISTANBUL UNIV, FAC LETTERS, DEPT GEOGRAPHY",ISTANBUL,"ORDU CAD.

A dominant narrative suggests that producing management practices best adapted to climate-change impacts is a matter of reconciling the supply of scientific knowledge with the demand signals of resource managers. We question this narrative with reference to the diverse cultural and socio-technical structures in which the future climate takes on meaning in water management. Using interviews (n=61), we analyze three ideal-typical social temporalities' of climate change: modeled futures, whose future?, and truncated futures. We define social temporalities as alternative constructions of the future built into socio-technical engagement with water and into collective orientations to climate change. Of the three ideal types, we found that only one (modeled futures) closely aligns with the supply-demand relationship as constructed in scholarly literature and climate adaptation-related policy. This leaves nonconforming types without guidance that resonates with their relationship to climate change information. Consideration of sociological dimensions of climate knowledge may warrant a revised or additional approach to climate service programs or related assistance efforts.","[Baker, Zeke] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Sociol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Ekstrom, Julia] Univ Calif Davis, Policy Inst Energy Environm & Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Bedsworth, Louise] State Calif, Governors Off Planning & Res, Sacramento, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Baker, Z (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Sociol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",ejbaker@ucdavis.edu,,"Ekstrom, Julia/0000-0003-1060-5276; Baker, Zeke/0000-0001-7544-8369",California Natural Resources Agency [California Fourth Climate Change Assessment]; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [83519401]; UC Office of the President's Multi-Campus Research Programs and Initiatives: UC Water [MR-15-328473]; University of California Water Security and Sustainability Research Initiative,California Natural Resources Agency [California Fourth Climate Change Assessment]; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency); UC Office of the President's Multi-Campus Research Programs and Initiatives: UC Water; University of California Water Security and Sustainability Research Initiative,"This work was supported by the California Natural Resources Agency [California Fourth Climate Change Assessment]; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [83519401]; and the UC Office of the President's Multi-Campus Research Programs and Initiatives [MR-15-328473]: UC Water, the University of California Water Security and Sustainability Research Initiative.",,58,8,8,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2325-1042,,,ENVIRON SOCIOL,Envir.

Hence the sector requires appropriately designed adaptation options to cope with on-going climate change. Studies on climate adaptation in perennial cropping systems are rare relative to those on annual crops. Based on a cross-sectional survey of 50 tea estate managers representing all tea growing areas in Sri Lanka, this study analyses factors affecting choice of preferred adaptation options, barriers to adaptation and associated policy implications for tea production as an example of a perennial tree crop system. Current adaptation options identified are crop diversification, soil conservation, and shade tree establishment and management. All of these options are adopted in some situations and locations. All estate managers interviewed believe that climate change is happening and almost all are experiencing the negative impacts of climate change on tea production. Results from a multinomial logit analysis show that information on climate change, company size, tea growing elevation, and increases in temperature and rainfall are key factors influencing the preferred choice of adaptation option. Furthermore, results reveal that barriers such as a lack capital, inadequate access to near-term and medium-term climate knowledge, and poor governmental and institutional support may prevent estate managers from experimenting with new adaptation options. Policies should, therefore, be aimed at promoting new adaptation options through information exchange between a wide range of stakeholders, and integrating climate change adaptation with Sri Lanka's sustainable developmental goals. Governmental and institutional support and involvement would be instrumental in facilitating adoption of adaptation options such as Joint-production of tea with valuable timber crops.","[Gunathilaka, R.

Developing countries do not have the means to cope with climate hazards and their economies are highly dependent on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, water, and coastal zones. Like most countries in Southern Africa, Zimbabwe suffers from climate-induced disasters. Therefore, this study maps critical aspects required for setting up a strong financial foundation for sustainable climate adaptation in Zimbabwe. It discusses the frameworks required for sustainable climate adaptation finance and suggests the direction for success in leveraging global climate financing towards building a low-carbon and climate-resilient Zimbabwe. The study involved a document review and analysis and stakeholder consultation methodological approach. The findings revealed that Zimbabwe has been significantly dependent on global finance mechanisms to mitigate the effects of climate change as its domestic finance mechanisms have not been fully explored. Results revealed the importance of partnership models between the state, individuals, civil society organisations, and agencies. Local financing institutions such as the Infrastructure Development Bank of Zimbabwe (IDBZ) have been set up. This operates a Climate Finance Facility (GFF), providing a domestic financial resource base. A climate change bill is also under formulation through government efforts. However, numerous barriers limit the adoption of adaptation practices, services, and technologies at the scale required. The absence of finance increases the vulnerability of local settlements (rural or urban) to extreme weather events leading to loss of life and property and compromised adaptive capacity. Therefore, the study recommends an adaptation financing framework aligned to different sectoral policies that can leverage diverse opportunities such as blended climate financing. The framework must foster synergies for improved impact and implementation of climate change adaptation initiatives for the country.","[Chirisa, Innocent] Univ Zimbabwe, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Dept Demog Settlement & Dev, Harare 263, Zimbabwe; [Chirisa, Innocent] Univ Free State, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, ZA-277 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Gumbo, Trynos; Moyo, Thembani] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Sustainable & Smart Cities & Reg Res Grp, ZA-277 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Gundu-Jakarasi, Veronica N.] Infrastruct Dev Bank Zimbabwe IDBZ, Harare 263, Zimbabwe; [Zhakata, Washington] Govt Zimbabwe, Minist Environm Climate Tourism & Hospitality, Harare 263, Zimbabwe; [Karakadzai, Thomas] Dialogue Shelter, Harare 263, Zimbabwe; [Dipura, Romeo] Univ Cape Town, Africa Ctr Cities, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Zimbabwe; University of Johannesburg; University of Cape Town,"Chirisa, I (corresponding author), Univ Zimbabwe, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Dept Demog Settlement & Dev, Harare 263, Zimbabwe.;Chirisa, I (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, ZA-277 Johannesburg, South Africa.",ichirisa@sociol.uz.ac.zw; tgumbo@uj.ac.za; verogundu@gmail.com; washingtonzhakata@gmail.com; thomkarakadzai27@gmail.com; rsdipura@gmail.com; tmoyo@uj.ac.za,"Moyo, Thembani/ACW-0399-2022; Jakarasi, Veronica Nonhlanhla Gundu/Q-5372-2017","Moyo, Thembani/0000-0001-9938-2907; Gumbo, Trynos/0000-0003-3617-4996; Dipura, Romeo/0000-0003-2552-5252",University of Johannesburg Library publications support Fund,University of Johannesburg Library publications support Fund,This work was funded by research funds of individual co-authors to enable proof reading and editing and the APC was funded by the University of Johannesburg Library publications support Fund.,,69,0,0,2,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2021,13,12,,,,,,,6517,10.3390/su13126517,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13126517,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,SZ1RW,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000666352400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The advent of the 4th industrial revolution has seen the increased application of digitalization in several fields and at different levels. High-tech digital devices, platforms and environments are increasingly being deployed to enhance productivity, efficiency and sustainability, and improve overall well-being of urban dwellers. Digitalization is projected to further impact cities in future, transform jobs and trigger life-style changes with far-reaching impacts that will ultimately affect cities' resilience and adaptation capacities. While a growing body of research has highlighted the significance of digitalization to climate change mitigation such as reducing GHG and CO2 emissions, comprehensive evaluations of the potentials of digitalization as an enabler of climate change adaptation remain scarce. This paper addresses this gap by analysing the current trend in digital revolution in relation to climate change adaptation and examines the likely challenges of digitalization. A desk research method was adopted, focusing on core digitalization concepts driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0). Nine case studies in cities across various continents were selected to assess the potentials of digitalization in addressing climatic hazards and to highlight benefits from implementing digitalization, while considering the social-ecological-technological challenges and tensions around IR 4.0. Our findings reveal the capabilities of digitalization in supporting more effective early warning and emergency response systems, enhancing food and water security, improving power infrastructure performance, enabling citizen engagement and participatory adaptation measures and minimizing the impacts of climatic hazards. Finally, we recommend feasible pathways to overcome present risks and challenges in order to optimize the numerous opportunities offered by digitalization in support of climate change adaptation initiatives.","[Balogun, Abdul-Lateef] UTP, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Geospatial Anal & Modelling GAM Res Grp, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia; [Marks, Danny] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Asian & Int Studies, Kowloon Tong, 83 Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Sharma, Richa] Publ Hlth Fdn India, Ctr Environm Hlth, Gurugram 122002, Haryana, India; [Shekhar, Himanshu] United Nat Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, UN Campus,Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Balmes, Chiden] UAE Off, GGGI, Incubator Bldg, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Maheng, Dikman] Univ Muhammadiyah Kendari, Dept Environm Engn, Jl Ahmad Dahlan 10, Kendari 93117, Indonesia; [Arshad, Adnan] China Agr Univ Beijing, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Salehi, Pourya] World Secretariat, ICLEI Local Govt Sustainabil, Res Team, Kaiser Friedrich Str 7, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",City University of Hong Kong; Public Health Foundation of India,"Balogun, AL (corresponding author), UTP, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Geospatial Anal & Modelling GAM Res Grp, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia.",geospatial63@gmail.com; danny.marks@cityu.edu.hk; richa.sharma85@gmail.com; shekhar@ehs.unu.edu; chidenb@gmail.com; dikman.maheng@gmail.com; adnan.poda@gmail.com; pourya.salehi@iclei.org,"Maheng, Muhammad Dikman/Z-5113-2019; Maheng, Muhammad Dikman MD/N-4182-2017; Balogun, Abdul-Lateef/AAH-2963-2020; Arshad, Adnan/ABB-9195-2020","Maheng, Muhammad Dikman/0000-0003-4777-2246; Maheng, Muhammad Dikman MD/0000-0003-4777-2246; Balogun, Abdul-Lateef/0000-0002-0418-3487; Arshad, Adnan/0000-0002-8755-5281; Marks, Danny/0000-0003-0833-880X; Shekhar, Himanshu/0000-0002-2793-5143; Salehi, Pourya/0000-0002-3292-5599",,,,,95,85,86,40,133,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

This article contributes to the understanding of farmers' adaptation choices, their determinants and their implications, in relation to the household income. In 2014, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and 220 household surveys were carried out with farmers in coffee and food crop zones in Central Kenya. The Heckmanmodel was used to evaluate the determinants of adaptation choices and their marginal effect. Farmers fromthe coffee zone or fromthe food crop zone perceive and adapt differently to climate change. Farmers who are aware of changes in climate are more willing to explore adaptation strategies. A positive relationship is found between adaptation to climate change and household income. The highest payoff/return is achieved if multiple adaptation choices are used rather than a single strategy. The choices of strategies are also determined by household characteristics, resource endowment, institutional variables, and climate information.

This, in turn, can adversely affect water resources as a result of flooding, coastal erosion, water scarcity etc. Singapore has been hailed for its progressive water policies and practices, which were developed to overcome its natural resource disadvantage (limited resource base) and to achieve self-sufficiency. Certainly, Singapore's geopolitical situation may have provided an atmosphere conducive to the development of progressive policies; however, it is worth exploring how Singapore is preparing for climate change adaptation, as this may allow other cities/countries to learn from Singapore's experience. The paper evaluates the contribution of Singapore's water policies and practices to climate change adaptation, and examines whether they can support the development of adaptation strategies in the water sector for other similarly situated cities in vulnerable countries.

Despite the potential of EbA to provide adaptation benefits, there is a lack of consensus on how to measure the success of this approach. This paper reviews the intended adaptation outcomes and indicators used by ongoing and completed EbA projects and addresses the following questions: (a) where have EbA projects been implemented? (b) what activities have been conducted by EbA projects? (c) what adaptation outcomes are EbA projects seeking to achieve? (d) how have the impacts of EbA projects been measured and evaluated? and (e) what is the set of indicators that can capture the diversity of adaptation outcomes achieved by EbA? To identify the adaptation outcomes provided by EbA and the indicators that could be used to measure such outcomes, we reviewed 58 EbA projects implemented globally, and obtained recommendations from experts on what indicators should be measured. We identified 13 adaptation outcomes that could be achieved through EbA, such as reducing the loss of assets of coastal communities due to extreme events. We identified seven indicators to monitor the success of EbA in achieving adaptation outcomes. Our review suggests that there is a strong need to better articulate the adaptation outcomes that EbA projects seek to achieve, to use a common set of specific indicators to track these outcomes, and to fund the monitoring of long-term EbA projects.","[Donatti, Camila I.; Harvey, Celia A.; Hole, David] Conservat Int, Betty & Gordon Moore Ctr Sci, 2011 Crystal Dr, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; [Harvey, Celia A.] Monteverde Inst, Monteverde, Puntarenas, Costa Rica; [Panfil, Steven N.] Green Climate Fund Agcy, Conservat Int, 2011 Crystal Dr, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; [Schurman, Hanna] Georgetown Univ, McCourt Sch Publ Policy, 37th & O Str NW, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Conservation International; Conservation International; Georgetown University,"Donatti, CI (corresponding author), Conservat Int, Betty & Gordon Moore Ctr Sci, 2011 Crystal Dr, Arlington, VA 22202 USA.",cdonatti@conservation.org,"Donatti, Camila I./AAV-2324-2020; Donatti, Camila/AAF-3605-2020",,Betty and Gordon Moore,Betty and Gordon Moore,This work was funded by a grant provided by Betty and Gordon Moore,,96,27,27,6,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

This topic has been taken up equally by professionals as well as the general public. Adaptation and mitigation actions are needed, especially in cities where the concentration of population and an increased demand for resources (e.g., water, food, land) are expected in the coming years. Already, 400 cities have been declared to be in a climate emergency state. There are no longer any doubts that current environmental state requires actions and solutions for both the alarming climate situation and urban quality life development. If such action is not going to be taken, the environmental state will deteriorate. One possible solution could be the use of green infrastructure. This research compares approaches to green areas and green infrastructure development in Bratislava (Slovakia) and Wroclaw (Poland). A comparison was made for projects realized between 2013 and 2018-i.e., since the publication of the European Union (EU) Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change in 2013. The research presents an overview of delivered projects regarding land use. The overview, which is supported by a density map of implemented green projects, verifies whether the new greenery fits and fills in the existing natural areas. Secondly, the green projects were analyzed according to years and land use types using Tableau software. Moreover, the legislation of climate adaptation mechanisms and practical aspects of green infrastructure implementation are shown. Finally, actions concerning the greening of the cities were categorized into practical, educational, and participatory ones, and the potential of green infrastructure as a positive landscape, micro-climate, health, and aesthetic influence was examined.","[Belcakova, Ingrid] Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Ecol & Environm Sci, UNESCO Dept Ecol Awareness & Sustainable Dev, Zvolen 96001, Slovakia; [Swiader, Malgorzata] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Fac Environm Engn & Geodesy, Dept Spatial Econ, PL-50375 Wroclaw, Poland; [Bartyna-Zielinska, Malgorzata] Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Architecture, Dept Urban Planning & Settlement Proc, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland",Technical University Zvolen; Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences; Wroclaw University of Science & Technology,"Belcakova, I (corresponding author), Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Ecol & Environm Sci, UNESCO Dept Ecol Awareness & Sustainable Dev, Zvolen 96001, Slovakia.",belcakova@tuzvo.sk; malgorzata.swiader@upwr.edu.pl; malgorzata.bartyna-zielinska@pwr.edu.pl,"Świąder, Małgorzata/A-3891-2017","Świąder, Małgorzata/0000-0003-3398-4985; Bartyna-Zielinska, Malgorzata/0000-0001-8080-6685","agency VEGA of the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport of the Slovak Republic [1/0096/16]","agency VEGA of the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport of the Slovak Republic","This research was funded by the agency VEGA of the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport of the Slovak Republic, Grant No. 1/0096/16.",,55,25,25,4,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,SEP,2019,10,9,,,,,,,552,10.3390/atmos10090552,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos10090552,,,23,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,JC3KJ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000489177300074,View Full Record in Web of Science

Three-stage probit model was employed for data analysis. Three adaptation strategies, namely: adoption of improved varieties, irrigation usage and intercropping were identified. The study result shows that Shantam, an improved potato variety, is the most widely grown in the study area. Frost, known as wurchi/ amadey by its local name, was found to be the worst types of climate change incidence that severely affects potato production in the study area. The analysis of sociodemographic variables showed mixed results on each of the three adaptation strategies.

Through faith-based networks, FGW has spread throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, and beyond, as a development intervention for improving food security, adapting to climate change, and restoring soil productivity for resource-poor farming households. This research identifies and compares the production, sustainability and faith claims of FGW to ascertain which claims are contested. A qualitative study of Canadian program managers with responsibilities for CA or FGW projects in Africa and smallholding FGW farmers in Kenya is employed using semi-structured interviews and focus groups. Production-related claims of improved soil moisture and climate change adaptation are generally consistent among program managers, farmers and the literature, but social claims of increased labour demand on women and religious claims of faith enhancing CA are contested. Findings show that female farmers unanimously contest the claim that their labour for weeding is increased under FGW. Similarly, FGW farmers contest the claim that faith inhibits adoption or innovation on the farm, reporting instead that FGW connects faith to their vocation, transforms why and how they farm, and changes mindsets for adopting faith-based CA.","[Spaling, Harry; Kooy, Kendra Vander] Kings Univ, Geog & Environm Studies Program, 9125-50 St NW, Edmonton, AB T6B 2H3, Canada",,"Spaling, H (corresponding author), Kings Univ, Geog & Environm Studies Program, 9125-50 St NW, Edmonton, AB T6B 2H3, Canada.",harry.spaling@kingsu.ca; kendravanderkooy@gmail.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [435-2016-0108],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We acknowledge the contributions of research assistants Erin Greidanus, Justin Wagenaar, Rehema Mukiri and James Ireri, and host partners Catherine Mwangi, Peter Maina and Stephan Lutz.

We argue that the key justice dilemmas of adaptation include responsibility for climate change impacts, the level and burden sharing of assistance to vulnerable countries for adaptation, distribution of assistance between recipient countries and adaptation measures, and fair participation in planning and making decisions on adaptation. We demonstrate how the climate change regime largely omits responsibility but makes a general commitment to assistance. However, the regime has so far failed to operationalise assistance and has made only minor progress towards eliminating obstacles for fair participation. We propose the adoption of four principles for fair adaptation in the climate change regime. These include avoiding dangerous climate change, forward-looking responsibility, putting the most vulnerable first and equal participation of all. We argue that a safe maximum standard of 400-500 ppm Of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere and a carbon tax of $20-50 per carbon equivalent ton could provide the initial instruments for operationalising the principles.

Nevertheless, existing literature associated with adaptation planning for climate change is still at an embryonic stage with little attention on certain potential dilemmas. Understanding such, this paper focuses on the question of how to respond to the barriers in climate adaptation planning in transport systems. This is achieved mainly through reviewing the literature in transport adaptation to climate change impacts to summarize eights conditions (potential barriers) that the shortage of those might lead to the failure of climate adaptation planning. Next, those conditions are examined by a historical case study between 2014 and 2015 on the Canadian port of Montreal's experience in tackling the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River's dropping water level. The findings, via semi-structured interviews with affiliated senior experts, closely mirror the enablers influencing the success of a climate adaptation plan, revealing the impediments and opportunities in the existing and future planning. It offers constructive recommendations on how to improve the port of Montreal's, and ports and transport infrastructures in general, process and practice of adaptation planning. The study strives to bridge the research gaps and provide decision-makers with a novel thinking pattern and workable recommendations from design, implementation to the reconstruction of adaptation planning and facilitate a paradigm shift in broader sustainable transport management.","[Wang, T.] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Ng, A.

As a response to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change call for National Adaptation Plans, Peru has developed a national and decentralized regional adaptation plans. The purpose of this article is to understand the role and priority status of health within the adaptation planning and process. Peru was used as a case study to analyse the policy process in the creation of adaptation plans, encompassing the need to address climate change impacts on health with a particular focus on marginalized people. An actor, content and context policy analyses were conducted to analyse 17 out of 25 regional adaptation plans, which are available. The national adaptation plans (2002, 2015) do not include health as a priority or health adaptation strategies. In a decentralized health care system, regional plans demonstrate an increased improvement of complexity, systematization and structure over time (2009-17). In general, health has not been identified as a priority but as another area of impact. There is no cohesiveness between plans in format, content, planning and execution and only a limited consideration for marginalized populations. In conclusion, the regional departments of Peru stand on unequal footing regarding adapting the health sector to climate change. Findings in the strategies call into question how mitigation and adaption to climate change may be achieved. The lack of local research on health impacts due to climate change and a particular focus on marginalized people creates a policy vacuum. The Peruvian case study resembles global challenges to put health in the centre of national and regional adaptation plans.

We develop a two-part conceptual framework linking social-ecological resilience to adaptation outcomes in NbS. Part one determines the potential of NbS to support resilience based on assessing whether NbS affect key mechanisms known to enable resilience. Examples include social-ecological diversity, connectivity, and inclusive decision-making. Part two includes adaptation outcomes that building social-ecological resilience can sustain, known as nature's contributions to adaptation (NCAs). We apply the framework to a global dataset of NbS in forests. We find evidence that NbS may be supporting resilience by influencing many enabling mechanisms. NbS also deliver many NCAs such as flood and drought mitigation. However, there is less evidence for some mechanisms and NCAs critical for resilience to long-term uncertainty. We present future research questions to better understand how NbS can continue to support social-ecological systems in a changing world.","[Turner, Beth; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Montreal, Ctr Etud Foret, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Turner, Beth; Chabaneix, Nicole; Woroniecki, Stephen; Seddon, Nathalie] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Nat Based Solut Initiat, Oxford, England; [Devisscher, Tahia] Univ British Columbia, Forest Sci Ctr, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Chabaneix, Nicole] WWF Us, Climate Adaptat & Resilience, Washington, DC USA; [Woroniecki, Stephen] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies, Environm Change Unit, Linkoping, Sweden; [Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee, Gatineau, PQ, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Oxford; University of British Columbia; World Wildlife Fund; Linkoping University; University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais,"Turner, B (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Montreal, Ctr Etud Foret, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Turner, B (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Nat Based Solut Initiat, Oxford, England.",cbeturner@gmail.com; tahia.devisscher@ubc.ca; nicolechabaneix@gmail.com; stephen.woroniecki@liu.se; messier.christian@uqam.ca; nathalie.seddon@zoo.ox.ac.uk,,,Doctoral Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship program [201709BPF-393653-294704]; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada; Waterloo Foundation,Doctoral Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship program; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Waterloo Foundation,"B.T. was supported by a Doctoral Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).

Three-stage sampling technique was used to select the study sites and sample households. Copies of 485 questionnaires were administered and complemented with data from focus group discussion and key informant interviews. Results of the descriptive analysis identified that use of soil and water conservation practices, planting trees, improved crop seeds, irrigation and use of non-farm income generating activities are the most utilized adaptation strategies to climate change. Results of the multinomial logistic regression (MNL) revealed that households' adaptation to climate change was found positively and significantly affected by education, livestock holding, cooperatives membership, extension services, farmers income and households perception to climate change. On the contrary, age of the household head, distance to market and agro-ecology were found negatively and statistically affecting smallholder farmers adoption of adaptation strategies to climate change. Thus, public policy on climate change adaptation need to take into account local people's resource base and their lifelong outlooks so as to reduce the potential drawbacks of climate change on farmers' livelihood.","[Gebru, Gebrehiwot Weldegebrial] Mekelle Univ, Dept Rural Dev & Agr Extens, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Ichoku, Hyacinth Ementa] Univ Nigeria, Dept Econ, Nsukka, Nigeria; [Phil-Eze, Philip Ogbonnia] Univ Nigeria, Dept Geog, Nsukka, Nigeria",Mekelle University; University of Nigeria; University of Nigeria,"Gebru, GW (corresponding author), Mekelle Univ, Dept Rural Dev & Agr Extens, Mekelle, Ethiopia.",gebre2007@gmail.com,,"Gebru, Gebrehiwot Weldegebrial/0000-0002-7296-7451; , philip/0000-0002-8129-245X",Mekelle University; RUFORUM [RU/2016/INTRA-ACP/RG/025]; Association of African Universities [PC/6],Mekelle University; RUFORUM; Association of African Universities,"This work was supported by Mekelle University (PhD Research, 2017), RUFORUM (RU/2016/INTRA-ACP/RG/025, 2017).

But, it is unclear how synergistic these two planning approaches are in practice. Focusing on flooding as a key climate-related hazard, this study examines planning frameworks and helps to address this gap by exploring HMPs and CCAPs in three US cities at the forefront of flood resilience planning.

Within the European Commission, interservice consultations (ISCs) play an important role to coordinate between the different directorate-generals. In spite of this importance, ISCs have so far not been analysed in a systematic way. This paper addresses this gap by systematically analysing the numbers, types and content of comments made in ISCs around climate change adaptation. Our analysis shows that ISCs were primarily used to provide substantive comments, related to problem analyses, objectives or instruments, as well as to strengthen or weaken connections with policy efforts in adjacent domains. Institutional comments, related to mandates or resources, proved rare. Moreover, we find that the types of comments given in ISCs are mediated by institutional factors that shape the temporal dynamics of policy processes. Rather than reflecting the ideal types of 'negative' and 'positive' coordination, the overall pattern of policy coordination in the ISCs typifies an in-between form of 'incremental policy coordination.'","[Candel, Jeroen J.

However, there is surprisingly limited systematic knowledge about whether and how adaptation policies have diffused and could diffuse in the future. Most existing adaptation studies do not explicitly examine policy diffusion, which is a form of interdependent policy-making among jurisdictions at the same or across different levels of governance. To address this gap, we offer a new interpretation and assessment of the extensive adaptation policy literature through a policy diffusion perspective; we pay specific attention to diffusion drivers and barriers, motivations, mechanisms, outputs, and outcomes. We assess the extent to which four motivations and related mechanisms of policy diffusion-interests (linked with learning and competition), rights and duties (tied to coercion), ideology, and recognition (both connected with emulation)-are conceptually and empirically associated with adaptation. We also engage with adaptation policy characteristics, contextual conditions (e.g., problem severity) and different channels of adapation policy diffusion (e.g., transnational networks). We demonstrate that adaptation policy diffusion can be associated with different mechanisms, yet many of them remain remarkably understudied. So are the effects of adaptation policy diffusion in terms of changes in vulnerability and resilience. We thus identify manifold avenues for future research, and provide insights for practitioners who may hope to leverage diffusion mechanisms to enhance their adaptation efforts.

Although estimating the precipitation retention time on land is difficult, estimating the lag between precipitation on land and a rise in lake water levels is possible. In this study, the delay times (using a depth metre installed in the mooring system in the northern basin of Lake Biwa from August 2017 to October 2018) were calculated using response functions, and it evaluated the precipitation retention time in the catchment. However, as several delays between the river surface flow (<1 d) and shallow subsurface flow (approximate to 45 d) remained unidentified, the delay times resulting from direct precipitation on the lake as well as from internal seiches were determined. The results suggest that delay times of approximately 20 d correspond to the paddy-waterway system between the river inflow and the subsurface flow, and that this effect corresponds to that of large rivers such as the Ane River. These findings can enhance water management strategies regarding the regulation of river flows, adapting to climate change-induced fluctuations in precipitation.","[Iwaki, Maho] Natl Inst Technol NIT, Maizuru Coll, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, 234 Shiroya, Kyoto 6258511, Japan; [Iwaki, Maho] Lake Biwa Museum, Res Div, Kusatsu 5250001, Japan; [Hayakawa, Kazuhide] Lake Biwa Environm Res Inst, Comprehens Anal Div, Otsu, Shiga 5200022, Japan; [Goto, Naoshige] Univ Shiga Prefecture, Sch Environm Sci, Hikone 5228533, Japan",University Shiga Prefecture,"Iwaki, M (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol NIT, Maizuru Coll, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, 234 Shiroya, Kyoto 6258511, Japan.;Iwaki, M (corresponding author), Lake Biwa Museum, Res Div, Kusatsu 5250001, Japan.",iwaki.maho.28n@kyoto-u.jp; hayakawa-k@lberi.jp; gotonao@ses.usp.ac.jp,,"Iwaki, Maho/0000-0001-6639-8873","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund [5-1607]; Ministry of the Environment, Japan","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund; Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan)","This research was partially performed by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund, number 5-1607, of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan.",,32,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,MAY,2022,13,5,,,,,,,724,10.3390/atmos13050724,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13050724,,,13,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,1S8WI,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000804324300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, significant gaps still exist in applying these theoretical frameworks and tools in policy and practice. There is also little agreement on which methods and frameworks are truly robust, while many developing countries lack access to key literature and data. Several issues are especially relevant for early career researchers and practitioners.

Links between grazing management and climate change adaptation and mitigation are included in the testimonies gathered during these studies but the resulting final reports are silent on the topic. Analysis of 112 parliamentary files revealed insights on (1) the knowledge about grazing management that was omitted from the two final reports, (2) the social contexts that informed the processes of hearing testimonies and developing the reports, and (3) the underlying ideologies and normative assumptions reflected in these studies. Overall, the current state of policy regarding climate change and agriculture emphasizes technical, scientific, and expensive solutions, and as a result, the benefits of grazing management are overlooked.

In view of the growing concern in the agricultural sector on this issue, we analyzed farm-level adaptation through amble land-use changes in the specific case of the Loam region in Belgium. With this aim, we used an agro-economic model which considered 20-year series of current and projected simulated yields with and without considering additional farming practices to reduce crop stress, such as irrigation and soil and water conservation techniques. Agronomic results show that climate change will negatively affect summer crop yields, particularly sugar beet and potatoes. However, we also show that adaptation to climate change through land-use changes can compensate for crop yield losses and lead to utility gains. These are obtained by reducing the share of land allocated to summer crops and barley and by increasing the surface allocated to less vulnerable crops such as winter wheat Finally, irrigation practices would not be justified in the Loam region under climate change, since their use would incur important financial costs for farmers.","[de Frutos Cachorro, Julia] Univ Barcelona, Dept Matemat Econ Financera & Actuarial, Avinguda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [de Frutos Cachorro, Julia] Univ Barcelona, BEAT, Avinguda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Gobin, Anne] Flemish Inst Technol Res VITO, Boeretang 200, B-2400 Mol, Belgium; [Buysse, Jeroen] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona; VITO; Ghent University,"Cachorro, JD (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Matemat Econ Financera & Actuarial, Avinguda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.;Cachorro, JD (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, BEAT, Avinguda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",j.defrutos@ub.edu,"de Frutos Cachorro, Julia/Q-5549-2016; Gobin, Anne/A-4986-2009","de Frutos Cachorro, Julia/0000-0001-8494-3943; Gobin, Anne/0000-0002-3742-7062",Belgian Science Policy Office (Belspo) under the Meteorological risks as drivers of environmental innovation in agro-ecosystem management (Merinova) project [SD/RI/03A],Belgian Science Policy Office (Belspo) under the Meteorological risks as drivers of environmental innovation in agro-ecosystem management (Merinova) project,"This work has been funded by the Belgian Science Policy Office (Belspo) under the Meteorological risks as drivers of environmental innovation in agro-ecosystem management (Merinova) project, with reference SD/RI/03A.",,58,14,14,2,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-521X,1873-2267,,AGR SYST,Agric.

This paper provides evidence on the impact of the agriculture-related external support on farmers' adaptation to climate change in the Central Highlands of Afghanistan. To this end, we collected primary data from 1434 farmers whom we interviewed across 14 districts in Bamiyan, Ghazni, and Diakundi provinces. We employ quasi-experimental econometric methods, including an endogenous switching regression analysis, to estimate the treatment effects on various adaptation-related outcomes. We find significant impacts of support interventions on the use of improved types of seeds and farmers' access to irrigation water. Further impacts on the risk of flood, economic and financial as well as government and institutional adaptation constraints appear to be significant, but sensitive to the existence of unobserved factors. We conclude that farmers perceived changes in the climate, and most of them tried to adapt by employing measures available to them. The impact of external support has been partially effective in addressing immediate and short-term farming challenges related to climate change and extreme weather events. They, however, have not been effective in treating long-term fundamental climate change-related risks. Based on our analysis of the past treatments and farmers' self-reported priorities, we provide a list of policy recommendations for adaptation to climate change in farming communities in Afghanistan.

This study explores the effects of sociocognitive factors on the climate change adaptation behaviour of farmers based on a survey of 475 local farmers in rural Southwest China. The results show that most farmers were aware of climate change and believed the probability of exposure to climate changes in the future was high. A few farmers agreed that implementing adaptation measures can reduce the adverse effects of climate change. Most farmers believed that their ability to address climate change was low and the adaptation cost was high. The estimation results show that farmers' perceptions of climate change and adaptation significantly affected their adaptation level and specific practices. Specifically, farmers' perceptions of the negative impacts of climate change and the perceived severity, probability, adaptation efficacy and self-efficacy have positive effects on their adaptation decisions, while perceived adaptation cost has a negative effect. Farmer-to-farmer interactions and access to markets are significant factors influencing adaptation to climate change. The findings of this study have implications for policy makers in terms of the promotion of the adaption behaviour of farmers in response to climate change in China and other developing countries.","[Jin, Jianjun] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Jin, Jianjun; Kuang, Foyuan; Wan, Xinyu; He, Rui; Ning, Jing] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Sch Nat Resources, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University,"Jin, JJ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Jin, JJ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Sch Nat Resources, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",jjjin@bnu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41771192]; Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program [2019QZKK0608],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program,We would like to thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41771192) and the second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (2019QZKK0608) for providing financial support to undertake this study.,,38,4,4,11,58,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

This article makes the case for an expanded research agenda on social contracts in climate and disasters scholarship as a mechanism to better reveal activity across this interface, identify the winners and losers of adaptation, and improve the equity outcomes of negotiated and imposed risk management settlements. Social contracts are defined as multiple and constructed (not singular or fixed), and three distinct yet intersecting forms of social contracts are identified: imagined, practiced, and legal-institutional. The article argues that mapping the disjunctures, overlaps and transitions between these concurrent social contracts can help reveal gaps between responsibilities held de facto and de jure. This makes a timely contribution to understanding tensions between need, obligation and entitlement that underlie contestations over who is responsible for what in risk governance. It also helps reveal the dynamic boundaries of social acceptances at the centre of debates around fair adaptation governance.

In this paper, we consider public perceptions of changes in average rainfall in India, analyzing the relationship between perceptions and the instrumental record. Using data from a national sample survey, we find that local instrumental records of precipitation are a strong predictor of perceived declines in rainfall. Perceptions of decreasing rainfall were also associated with perceptions of changes in extreme weather events, such as decreasing frequency of floods and severe storms, increasing frequency of droughts, and decreasing predictability of the monsoon. Higher social vulnerability-including low perceived adaptive capacity and greater food and livelihood dependence on local weather-was also associated with perceptions of decreasing rainfall. While both urban and rural respondents were likely to perceive local changes in precipitation, we show that rural respondents in general were more sensitive to actual changes in precipitation. Individual perceptions of changes in local climate may play an important role in shaping vulnerability to global climate change, adaptive behavior, and support for adaptation and mitigation policies. Awareness of local climate change is therefore particularly important in regions where much of the population is highly exposed and sensitive to the impacts of climate change.","[Howe, Peter D.] Utah State Univ, Quinney Coll Nat Resources, Dept Environm & Soc, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Thaker, Jagadish] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Commun & New Media, Singapore 117416, Singapore; [Leiserowitz, Anthony] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06405 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; National University of Singapore; Yale University,"Howe, PD (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Quinney Coll Nat Resources, Dept Environm & Soc, 5215 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",peter.howe@usu.edu; jthaker@nus.edu.sg; anthony.leiserowitz@yale.edu,"Leiserowitz, Anthony/HGB-4208-2022; Leiserowitz, Anthony/ABE-6529-2020; Thaker, Jagadish/AAU-4301-2020","Leiserowitz, Anthony/0000-0001-5349-409X; Thaker, Jagadish/0000-0003-4589-7512; Howe, Peter/0000-0002-1555-3746",Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation; Rice Family Foundation,Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation; Rice Family Foundation,Funding for survey data collection was provided by the Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation and the Rice Family Foundation.,,49,22,22,0,53,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Pavements will be significantly affected by increased temperatures, precipitation, and flooding, and will require present design methodology to be modified accordingly. Several climate change adaptation strategies are easily available to agencies including upgraded asphalt binder grades, increased Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) thickness, modified mix gradations, and stabilized base. The objective of this study is to investigate Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) for climate change adaptation strategies across various locations in Canada, from a Global Warming Potential (GWP) perspective. All analysis was completed leveraging the Athena Pavement LCA software and the LTPP database. The investigated scenarios were (i) a baseline asphalt pavement with no climate change, (ii) a baseline asphalt pavement with climate change, and (iii) an asphalt pavement adapted to withstand climate change, appropriate to the level of changes experienced by the specific location. The study revealed that although there are initial increases in both cost and emission to administer these adaptation strategies, they are offset over the life of the pavements. Increasing the HMA thickness and using stabilized bases were the most expensive and the highest emitting among the inves-tigated strategies, but they are only necessary for extreme coastal climate change regions including British Columbia and Newfoundland. British Columbia is expected to observe a near 30% increase in agency costs to effectively adapt their pavements to climate change. However, these initiatives were found to decrease the overall global warming potential by nearly 10% in comparison to not adapting. The other examined locations, although not returning as drastic of changes, followed similar trends. The conclusions find that climate change adaptation strategies are highly beneficial from the standpoint of both an LCA and LCCA for all of the investi-gated locations.","[Swarna, Surya Teja; Hossain, Kamal] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Civil Engn, St John, NL A1C 5S7, Canada; [Swarna, Surya Teja] Rowan Univ, Ctr Res & Educ Adv Transportat Engn Syst CREATEs, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Glassboro, NJ 08028 USA; [Hossain, Kamal; Bernier, Alyssa] Adv Rd & Transportat Engn Lab ARTEL, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Memorial University Newfoundland; Rowan University,"Swarna, ST (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Civil Engn, St John, NL A1C 5S7, Canada.",stswarna@mun.ca; kamal.hossain@carleton.ca; alyssabernier@cmail.carleton.ca,"Swarna, Surya Teja/AAD-6684-2020","Swarna, Surya Teja/0000-0003-0406-6675; Bernier, Alyssa/0000-0001-8777-070X; Hossain, Kamal/0000-0003-1155-9347",,,,,31,0,0,10,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

As such, they are the authoritative and legally accepted standards for project design and construction. Engineering codes and standards are developed to optimize public safety and performance by focusing on structural reliability, which includes a wide range of extreme conditions that encompass most contemporary climate uncertainties, and which are likely to overlap some portion of future climate non-stationary conditions. Current practices of risk-based planning and design standards have evolved incrementally, responding to each catastrophic natural disaster, whether it is geotechnical, floods, droughts or hurricanes. Design standards and building codes encompass an accumulation of changes that progressively reflect changing climate conditions, most notably because they focus on climate extremes. Design standards and embedded 'safety factors' that are based on extremes are likely to encompass a good deal of an anticipated non-stationary climate regime and its associated uncertainties. Modern risk analysis methods and risk-based standards, codes and methods comprise an important part of a progressive autonomous adaptation to climate change. They represent an essential component of 'no regrets' climate adaptation.","[Stakhiv, Eugene Z.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Environm Sci Studies Dept, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Stakhiv, Eugene Z.] UNESCO Int Ctr Integrated Water resources Managem, Alexandria, VA 22315 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Stakhiv, EZ (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Environm Sci Studies Dept, Washington, DC 20036 USA.;Stakhiv, EZ (corresponding author), UNESCO Int Ctr Integrated Water resources Managem, Alexandria, VA 22315 USA.",estakhi1@jhu.edu,,,,,,,104,1,1,3,7,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",1366-7017,1996-9759,,WATER POLICY,Water Policy,DEC,2021,23,,,1,SI,,106,127,,10.2166/wp.2021.345,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wp.2021.345,,,22,Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Water Resources,XQ7SK,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000731744100008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The poor results of the mitigation policies and the more destructive climate change impacts nowadays give climate change adaptation a privileged place in political discourse and in academic literature as a desirable and necessary goal. This article discusses that idea. Based on a review of the authors who contributed to the genesis of adaptation thinking, the origin of the concept, its first uses in evolutionary biology and its subsequent incorporation into the literature and policy on climate change of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are traced, in order to recover the critique from Latin American and anglophones authors to the use of biological categories to explain social processes, as well as the multiplicity of projects and interests that are legitimized and adopted in the name of adaptation. Finally, it is suggested to rethink the usefulness of adaptation from a transdisciplinary perspective, that replaces biological reductionism and commits itself to socio-environmental justice.","[Islas Vargas, Maritza] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Vargas, MI (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",islasvm@gmail.com,,,,,,,63,1,1,13,43,"FAC LATINOAMERICANA CIENCIAS SOCIALES-FLACSO, ECUADOR",QUITO,"CALLE PRADERA E7-174 & DIEGO ALMAGRO, QUITO, 00000, ECUADOR",1390-6631,,,LET VERDES,Let Verdes,SEP-FEB,2021,,28,,,,,9,30,,10.17141/letrasverdes.28.2020.4333,http://dx.doi.org/10.17141/letrasverdes.28.2020.4333,,,22,Environmental Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,SA4AA,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000649238600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A goal of CCA projects is to reduce poverty and promote social justice. The case of the threat of displacement of the community of Kewunor by the Trasacco Estate Development Company (TEDC), after the construction of the Ada Sea Defense System (AdSDS) of Ghana as a CCA, is illustrative of this concept of (mal)adaptation opportunism. Through a narrative presentation of eight different accounts concerning this issue, I demonstrate how (mal)adaptation opportunism arises and is often motivated by economic interests.

Decisions around national adaptation policy are made predominantly by the relevant lead ministry, contrasting with where funding originates from (i.e., major donors, multilaterals, United Nation agencies). Adaptation policy is thus the result of a process of coproduction by state and nonstate actors. The research we present sought to understand the relationships that exist between knowledge-and decision-makers with respect to climate change adaptation in the health and water sectors in Cambodia, and the factors that enabled or constrained these relationships. Forty-four interviews were conducted with representatives of 32 organizations. We found that coproductive relationships were most effective when there were clearly defined roles and responsibilities, coordination of technical and financial resources, and trust. The two key factors of coproductive capacity that enabled and supported these partnerships were scientific resources and governance capability. Ultimately, the roles and responsibilities given to various actors requires commensurate funding and greater consideration of existing relationships and power dynamics. The reliance on international scientific expertise also needs to be challenged so that local research capabilities can be developed and locally relevant, problem-specific information can be provided. The ongoing funding, codevelopment, and sharing of such knowledge would significantly enhance trust and cooperation.","[Bowen, Kathryn J.] Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Bowen, Kathryn J.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sustainable Soc Inst, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Bowen, Kathryn J.; Miller, Fiona P.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Miller, Fiona P.; Graham, Sonia] Univ Melbourne, Dept Resource Management & Geog, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Dany, Va] Royal Univ Phnom Penh, Dept Environm, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Dany, Va] Bond Univ, Inst Sustainable Dev & Architecture, Southport, Qld 4229, Australia",Australian National University; University of Melbourne; Macquarie University; University of Melbourne; Bond University,"Bowen, KJ (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"Graham, Sonia/G-4399-2012","Graham, Sonia/0000-0003-4195-4559; Bowen, Kathryn/0000-0002-2125-1963; Miller, Fiona/0000-0003-4427-6466",AusAID Australian Development Research Awards (ADRA) [ADRA0800117],AusAID Australian Development Research Awards (ADRA),The authors wish to gratefully acknowledge that the research this paper is based upon has been made possible through an AusAID Australian Development Research Awards (ADRA) grant (ADRA0800117) for the project entitled Evaluating the Connections and Contributions of Climate Change Vulnerability Assessments to Adaptation Strategies in the Health and Water Sectors: A Three-Country Study in the Asia-Pacific Region.

The climate change adaptation measure considered here is the reduction of tropical cyclone risk through the improvement of coastal polders. The study exploits a unique policy context and uses household data obtained through a contingent valuation survey asking whether 400 randomly sampled male and female inhabitants would pay a one-off surcharge to co-finance the Coastal Embankment Improvement Project (CEIP)-the centrepiece of the Bangladesh Government's climate change adaptation policy in the coastal zone. A social cohesion index is constructed by summing subjective indicators of trust, mutual co-operation and confidence in collective action. Controlling for a large number of individual, household and community characteristics and village fixed effects, the regression results reveal a significant positive relationship between the social cohesion index and willingness to pay for polder improvement. The study finds a significant welfare benefit of and widespread public support for the CEIP. The mean one-off will-ingness to pay to support the CEIP varies from US$35 to US$65.","[Akter, Sonia] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, 469C Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 259772, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Akter, S (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, 469C Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 259772, Singapore.",sonia.akter@nus.edu.sg,"Akter, Sonia/J-2208-2014","Akter, Sonia/0000-0001-5644-9403",Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy; National University of Singapore [R-603-000-173-720],Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy; National University of Singapore(National University of Singapore),"This study is funded by the Staff Research Support Scheme (SRSS) of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, the National University of Singapore (grant id#R-603-000-173-720).

We argue that adaptation is a socio-political process that mediates how individuals and collectives deal with multiple and concurrent environmental and social changes. We propose that applying concepts of subjectivity, knowledges and authority to the analysis of adaptation focuses attention on this socio-political process. Drawing from vulnerability, adaptation, political ecology and social theory literatures, we explain how power is reproduced or contested in adaptation practice through these three concepts. We assert that climate change adaptation processes have the potential to constitute as well as contest authority, subjectivity and knowledge, thereby opening up or closing down space for transformational adaptation. We expand on this assertion through four key propositions about how adaptation processes can be understood and outline an emergent empirical research agenda, which aims to explicitly examine these propositions in specific social and environmental contexts. We describe how the articles in this special issue are contributing to this nascent research agenda, providing an empirical basis from which to theorize the politics of adaptation. The final section concludes by describing the need for a reframing of adaptation policy, practice and analysis to engage with multiple adaptation knowledges, to question subjectivities inherent in discourses and problem understandings, and to identify how emancipatory subjectivities - and thus the potential for transformational adaptation - can be supported.

Upper-level governments are well positioned to create an enabling environment for adaptation and build local public health authorities' capacity, yet adaptation literature has not specified how upper-level governments can build local-level adaptive capacity. In this paper we examine how federal and regional governments can contribute to enabling and supporting public health adaptation to climate change at the local level in federal systems. We outline the local level's self-assessed adaptive capacity for public health adaptation in Canadian and German comparative case studies, in terms of funding, knowledge and skills, organizations, and prioritization, drawing upon 30 semi-structured interviews. Based on interviewees' recommendations and complemented by scientific literature, we develop a set of practical measures that could enable or support local-level public health adaptation. We find that adaptive capacity varies widely between local public health authorities, but most report having insufficient funding and staff for adaptation activities. We propose 10 specific measures upper-level governments can take to build local public health authorities' capacity for adaptation, under the interrelated target areas of: building financial capital; developing and disseminating usable knowledge; collaborating and coordinating for shared knowledge; and claiming leadership. Federal and regional governments have an important role to play in enabling local-level public health adaptation, and have many instruments available to them to fulfill that role. Selecting and implementing measures to enable local public health authorities' adaptive capacity will require tailoring to, and consideration, of the local context and needs.","[Austin, Stephanie E.; Ford, James D.; Berrang-Ford, Lea; Ross, Nancy A.] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Burnside Hall Bldg,Room 705, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada; [Austin, Stephanie E.; Ford, James D.; Berrang-Ford, Lea; Biesbroek, Robbert] Tracking Adaptat Climate Change Collaborat TRAC3, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Austin, Stephanie E.; Ford, James D.; Berrang-Ford, Lea; Biesbroek, Robbert] Tracking Adaptat Climate Change Collaborat TRAC3, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Ford, James D.; Berrang-Ford, Lea] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Biesbroek, Robbert] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands",McGill University; University of Leeds; Wageningen University & Research,"Austin, SE (corresponding author), Burnside Hall Bldg,Room 705, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada.",stephanie.austin@mailmcgill.ca; j.ford2@leeds.ac.uk; l.berrangford@leeds.ac.uk; robbert.biesbroek@wur.nl; nancy.ross@mcgill.ca,"Ford, James/A-4284-2013; Biesbroek, Robbert/GZZ-4476-2022; Biesbroek, Robbert/ABE-3686-2021","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456; Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419; Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419",Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Fonds de Recherche du Quebec - Sante (Bourse de Formation de Maitrise); Trottier Institute for Science and Public Policy,Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Fonds de Recherche du Quebec - Sante (Bourse de Formation de Maitrise); Trottier Institute for Science and Public Policy,"The authors would like to thank the interviewees for participating in this research.

The findings are based on a survey, which applied a choice experiment (CE) to investigate forest owners' perceptions of climate change, their motivation for forest ownership and their planned management behaviour under conditions of climate change. Overall, a total of 919 forest owners participated in the questionnaire, 20% of which were female participants from all over Austria. Female forest owners were analysed in comparison to their male counterparts, focussing on the duration of forest ownership, motivation and their preferred forest tending and maintenance approaches. Furthermore, we analysed the likelihood of female participants to apply climate change adaptation strategies in their forests. The findings reveal significant differences and demonstrate that tailored approaches are required when reaching out to females in order to influence their decision-making processes. Therefore, new approaches are necessary, which are specifically addressed to female small-scale private forest owners.","[Proebstl-Haider, U.; Mostegl, N.

Vulnerability and resilience are two important concepts in the literature on hazards and climate change but have been used in a variety of ways to investigate human interaction with a hazardous environment. The result is widespread adoption of the terms but confusion about their relationship and how best they can advance work on climate change adaptation. This paper critically reviews the different understandings of the concepts and how they relate, and then proposes a framework that integrates vulnerability and resilience in order to advance adaptation thinking, planning and implementation. The paper concludes with a description of how the framework will apply findings on unequal social vulnerability to inform adaptation options that increase resilience in coastal cities.","[Joakim, Erin P.; Mortsch, Linda] Univ Waterloo, Fac Environm, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Oulahen, Greg] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Geog, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",University of Waterloo; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Joakim, EP (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Fac Environm, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",ejoakim@uwaterloo.ca,,,Coastal Cities at Risk: Building Capacity for Managing Climate Change in Coastal Megacities (CCaR) project; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canadian Institutes for Health Research; International Development Research Council under the International Research Initiative on Adaptation to Climate Change (IRIACC),Coastal Cities at Risk: Building Capacity for Managing Climate Change in Coastal Megacities (CCaR) project; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Canadian Institutes for Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); International Development Research Council under the International Research Initiative on Adaptation to Climate Change (IRIACC),"This collaboration was undertaken as part of work that is supported by the Coastal Cities at Risk: Building Capacity for Managing Climate Change in Coastal Megacities (CCaR) project.

Some initiatives, such as the Brazilian Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change (BPACC) highlights sustainable urban drainage as a key strategy for promoting sustainable cities, including ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) measures. Despite the importance of these national guidelines, little is known about how the recommendations are incorporated and the provision of ecosystem services are perceived in local initiatives. We aim to explore stakeholders' perception of ecosystem services in relation to public urban programs for improving the local environment through EbA measures. For this, we studied a stream revitalization project in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, as an emblematic case by integrating three public programs: re-urbanization of irregular settlements, implementation of linear parks and cleansing of urban streams. Our methods involved literature review, documentary data, field surveys and semi-structured interviews with local populations, public agents, and NGOs. Despite some positive results of supplying ecosystem services, we recommend that local programs expand the scope of EbA measures based on BPACC guidelines, strengthen the specific objectives of the three individual public programs and better manage public resources, especially in the context of promoting resilient cities in developing countries. At the same time, local programs can teach lessons and show opportunities for improving national guidelines on climate change adaptation.","[de Oliveira Rolo, Daniella Aparecida de Mattos; Gallardo, Amarilis Lucia Casteli Figueiredo; Ribeiro, Andreza Portella] Uninove, Programa Mestrado Cidades Inteligentes & Sustenta, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Gallardo, Amarilis Lucia Casteli Figueiredo; Siqueira-Gay, Juliana] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Politecn, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Nove de Julho; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Gallardo, ALCF (corresponding author), Uninove, Programa Mestrado Cidades Inteligentes & Sustenta, Sao Paulo, Brazil.;Gallardo, ALCF (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Politecn, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",amarilislcfgallardo@gmail.com,"Portella, Andreza A/B-9754-2017; Gallardo, Amarilis Lucia Casteli Figueiredo/AGX-6919-2022","Portella, Andreza A/0000-0002-1763-4558; Gallardo, Amarilis Lucia Casteli Figueiredo/0000-0002-5169-997X","CNPq (the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development) [309358/2017-5, 303542/2020-9]; FAPESP (the State of Sao Paulo Research Foundation) [2019/18988-9]; Capes (the Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel) [001]",CNPq (the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPESP (the State of Sao Paulo Research Foundation)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Capes (the Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),The second author gratefully acknowledges CNPq (the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development -grant 309358/2017-5 and grant 303542/2020-9).

It is widely accepted that the poorest communities are the most vulnerable, because they lack access even to the most basic urban services placing them at a comparative disadvantage and challenging their capabilities to take on additional stresses caused by climate change. Such complex vulnerabilities require comprehensive responses that link climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts to the sustainable development of these communities enhancing their adaptive capacity. It is not sufficient to concentrate on either mitigation or adaptation, but a combination of these results in the most sustainable outcomes. Yet, these two strategies do not always complement each other, but can be counterproductive. A similar argument can be made for linking climate change adaptation with sustainable development. In order to avoid these conflicts, priorities need to be set. This calls for a methodology and comparison tool to assess the most cost-effective and appropriate strategies for each community. Strategies need to be evaluated in terms of their negative consequences and priority given to those that minimize these. This article includes case Studies of successful adaptation and mitigation strategies Suggesting that these successes be translated into local contexts and communalized with the involvement of local authorities using participatory approaches. Successful outcomes integrate different adaptation and mitigation strategies with the overall development goals of the community through local government leadership, comprehensive planning and prioritization.

The article explores the relationship between population change and adaptive capacity through detailed examination of empirical findings from a study of small communities in eastern Ontario, Canada currently experiencing a combination of changes in local climatic conditions and rapid demographic change caused by in-migration of urban retirees and out-migration of young, educated people. The combination of changing demographic and climatic patterns has placed increased stress on local social networks that have long been critical to climate adaptation in that region. The case study and literature review are used to create a general typology of the relationship between population change and vulnerability that may be used as a framework for future research in this field.","Univ Ottawa, Dept Geog, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"McLeman, R (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Geog, Room 031 Simard Hall, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",rmcleman@uottawa.ca,,"McLeman, Robert/0000-0001-9593-1606",,,,,80,46,48,1,52,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0199-0039,1573-7810,,POPUL ENVIRON,Popul.

Despite ongoing discussion of adopting interventions for improving adaptation and adaptive capacity to climate change, practitioners often continue to carry out conventional management strategies that do not effectively incorporate climate change impacts and projections. Using a web-based survey and semi-structured interviews, we explored the perceptions of practitioners (coastal managers and planners) in British Columbia, Canada relative to climate change risks, adaptation actions for social and ecological systems, and barriers for adaptation within the region. Overall, practitioners shared a concern that climate change is not currently well incorporated in management or policy in this region, and noted significant implementation gaps. Practitioners expressed more support for ecological adaptation actions that are well suited to regional implementation, such as incorporating climate change projections into management and reducing fisheries over-exploitation, than for actions such as protecting specific areas. Social adaptation actions were overall perceived as less useful than ecological adaptation actions, and actions that would support local management and monitoring efforts were viewed as more useful than developing alternative livelihoods. The main barriers and associated opportunities for climate change adaptation in marine management included political action, reducing scientific uncertainty, improving communication, and increasing capacity (both funding and staff). Additional opportunities include effective engagement with Indigenous governance, improving policies and funding for adaptation including monitoring, and focusing efforts on communication and education programs specific to practitioners and communities. This study demonstrates the necessity of collaboration across scales of management for effective climate change adaptation.","[Whitney, Charlotte K.; Ban, Natalie C.] Univ Victoria, Sch Environm Studies, 3800 Finnerty Rd, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada; [Whitney, Charlotte K.] Pacific Inst Climate Solut, Victoria, BC, Canada",University of Victoria,"Whitney, CK (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Sch Environm Studies, 3800 Finnerty Rd, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada.;Whitney, CK (corresponding author), Pacific Inst Climate Solut, Victoria, BC, Canada.",ckw@uvic.ca,,,Central Coast Indigenous Resource Alliance; National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Graduate Fellowship [475091]; Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions (PIGS) Fellowship; University of Victoria Human Research Ethics Board [17-252]; SSHRC; NSERC; OceanCanada Partnership,Central Coast Indigenous Resource Alliance; National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Graduate Fellowship(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions (PIGS) Fellowship; University of Victoria Human Research Ethics Board; SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); OceanCanada Partnership,"Thank you to all of the respondents to the survey who shared their valuable time, and particularly those who agreed to an interview.

The research uses an innovative approach to value chain analysis, namely the three-step Value Chain Analysis for Resilience in Drylands (VC-ARID) that considers the specific characteristics of semi-arid systems. All the respondents interviewed along the value chain have perceived changes in rainfall, temperature and climate extremes - especially drought - over the past 15 years and have experienced the impacts of these changes on their livestock. The findings show that pastoralist producers need to invest in fattening programmes at their ranches or via feedlots to increase the quality of the beef they produce. There is significant potential to improve the fattening stage in the value chain, since it would contribute towards meeting demand in the expanding high-end markets that require finished, top-quality meats.","[Ndiritu, S.

Therefore, it is imperative that policy makers in regions such as Africa begin to consider what measures they should take to adapt to the potential conseqences of climate change. A number of adaptation policies are suggested here. The policies address general adaptation measures as well as specific measures in water resources, coastal resources (adapting to sea-level rise), forests, ecosystems, and agriculture. These measures would enhance the flexibility of resources to adapt to climate change and would have net benefits greater than costs. In some cases, the measures make sense without considering climate change because they help address current climate variability.

Floods are its costliest form of natural disaster accounting for losses estimated at over $300 million per annum. This article presents an historical case study of climate adaptation of an Australian town that is subject to frequent flooding. Charleville is a small, inland rural town in Queensland situated on an extensive flood plain, with no significant elevated areas available for relocation. The study aimed to gain an understanding of the vulnerability, resilience and adaptive capacity of this community by studying the 2008 flood event. Structured questionnaires were administered in personal interviews in February 2010 to householders and businesses affected by the 2008 flood, and to institutional personnel servicing the region (n = 91). Data were analysed using appropriate quantitative and qualitative techniques. Charleville was found to be staunchly resilient, with high levels of organisation and cooperation, and well-developed and functioning social and institutional networks. The community is committed to remaining in the town despite the prospect of continued future flooding. Its main vulnerabilities included low levels of insurance cover (32% residents, 43% businesses had cover) and limited monitoring data to warn of impending flooding. Detailed flood modelling and additional river height gauging stations are needed to enable more targeted evacuations. Further mitigation works (e.g., investigate desilting Bradley's Gully and carry out an engineering assessment) and more affordable insurance products are needed. Regular information on how residents can prepare for floods and the roles different organisations play are suggested. A key finding was that residents believe they have a personal responsibility for preparation and personal mitigation activities, and these activities contribute substantially to Charleville's ability to respond to and cope with flood events. More research into the psychological impacts of floods is recommended. Charleville is a valuable representation of climate change adaptation and how communities facing natural disasters should organise and operate.","[Keogh, Diane U.; Apan, Armando; Mushtaq, Shahbaz] Univ So Queensland, Australian Ctr Sustainable Catchments, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [King, David; Thomas, Melanie] James Cook Univ, Ctr Disaster Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [King, David; Thomas, Melanie] James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Urban & Reg Planning, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Apan, Armando] Univ So Queensland, Fac Engn & Surveying, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia",University of Southern Queensland; James Cook University; James Cook University; University of Southern Queensland,"Keogh, DU (corresponding author), Univ So Queensland, Australian Ctr Sustainable Catchments, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia.",dianekeogh@westnet.com,"Apan, Armando A/C-2977-2017; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Apan, Armando A/C-6767-2009","Apan, Armando A/0000-0002-5412-8881; Apan, Armando A/0000-0002-5412-8881",National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF),National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF),"Our appreciation is extended to the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF) for funding this work.

The main objective was to understand the linkage of participation with Community Based Adaptation (CBA) to climate change. Institutional framework following different types of conceptual theories (collective action, group, game and social learning theory) was utilized to analyze the participatory process in local community level Village Disaster Mangement Committee (VDMC) that works in collaboration with local government. Field level data was collected through interview and group discussion during 25 April to 30 May 2015 in the Teesta riverine area of northern Bangladesh. Results showed that flood and drought were the major climate change impacts in the study area, and various participatory tools were used for risk assessment and undertaking action plans to overcome the climate change challenges by the group VDMC. Participation in VDMC generated both relational and technical outcomes. The relational outcomes are the informal institutional changes through which local community adopt technological adaptation measures. Although, limitations like bargaining problem, free riding or conflict were found in collective decision making, but the initiation of local governance like VDMC has brought various institutional change in the communities in terms of adaptation practices. More than 80% VDMC and around 40-55% non-VDMC household respondents agreed that overall community based adaptation process was successful in the previous year. They believed that some innovative practices had been brought in the community through VDMC action for climate change adaptation. No doubt that the CBA has achieved good progress to achieve the government Comprehensive Disaster Management (CDM) strategy of climate change adaptation. But, there is still lack of coordination among local government, NGOs and civil partners in working together. Research related to socio-economic impact analysis for the sustainability of adaptation measures implemented through local community could be undertaken in future. (C) 2017 The Authors.

However, much emphasis is placed on climate change adaptation (CCA) in crop production whilst not adequately addressing the CCA in postharvest management of maize. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among smallholder farmers. Key informant interviews, observations and structured interviews on 280 household heads were done. Binary logistic regression was used to analyse determinants of use of postharvest CCA practices whilst multinomial logistic regression was used to analyse determinants of use of postharvest storage facilities. Farmers used grain protectants (40.4%) and minimised the duration of the harvesting process (34.3%) as their major CCA practices in maize postharvest management. There was a significant difference in postharvest maize loss quantities (p <= 0.05) between users and non-users of CCA practices. The choice and use of climate-resilient postharvest strategies were significantly influenced by location, cultivated land, access to radio and membership to farmer club. Choice of a postharvest storage facility was significantly influenced by training and membership to farmers' club. Smallholder farmers are using some conventional maize postharvest management practices like grain protectants to adapt to the effects of climate change.

Strengthening local adaptive capacity is a critical component of adapting to climate change. Based on fieldwork in two areas in Kenya, we investigate how people seek to access livelihood adjustment options and promote particular adaptation interests through forming social relations and political alliances to influence collective decision-making. First, we find that, in the face of drought and conflict, relations are formed among individuals, politicians, customary institutions, and government administration aimed at retaining or strengthening power bases in addition to securing material means of survival. Second, national economic and political structures and processes affect local adaptive capacity in fundamental ways, such as through the unequal allocation of resources across regions, development policy biased against pastoralism, and competition for elected political positions. Third, conflict is part and parcel of the adaptation process, not just an external factor inhibiting local adaptation strategies. Fourth, there are relative winners and losers of adaptation, but whether or not local adjustments to drought and conflict compound existing inequalities depends on power relations at multiple geographic scales that shape how conflicting interests are negotiated locally. Climate change adaptation policies are unlikely to be successful or minimize inequity unless the political dimensions of local adaptation are considered; however, existing power structures and conflicts of interests represent political obstacles to developing such policies.","[Eriksen, Siri] Univ Oslo, Dept Sociol & Human Geog, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Lind, Jeremy] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Civil Soc, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of Oslo; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Eriksen, S (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Sociol & Human Geog, POB 1096, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",siri.eriksen@sgeo.uio.no,,"Lind, Jeremy/0000-0002-2912-6235",Research Council of Norway; Global Environmental Change and Human Security Project,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Global Environmental Change and Human Security Project,"We thank the local administration, community leaders, and ordinary people in Kitui and Turkana districts who agreed to be interviewed for this research.

The study utilized both qualitative and quantitative approaches (mixed method). For the quantitative aspect of the study, a quota-sampling technique was employed in the selection of 650 respondents for the study using a well-structured questionnaire. The quota representation was based on age and gender. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and binary logit regression. In addition, qualitative content/topic analysis of an in-depth interview of the respondents was employed in further analyzing why and how policy makers can improve climate change adaptation. Findings from the study indicate the dire need for continued government support in household and individual adaptation in Leeds, and this support should also be encouraged in other cities where government intervention is low. Interventions in the form of subsidies, direct regulations, and public awareness are needed. The implementation of these measures is expected to generate a wide range of additional benefits to most vulnerable groups who should be central to the rapidly expanding climate change research and policy agenda in the United Kingdom. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Evidence shows that periods of extremely cold winters have been perceived to have increased in frequency in the United Kingdom over the years. This points to the need to uncover what policy and behavioral adaptation measures required to improve individual and household adaptation measures to cold spells in the United Kingdom. We utilized both qualitative and quantitative approaches (mixed method) to find out the drivers and hindrances to adaptation against cold spells, using Leeds as a case study. We found out that over 70% of the respondents adopted all of the short-term coping strategies, whereas 55% did not indicate any changes in their behavior in response to cold spells. Also, government support, the prospect of relocation (people's intention of leaving their home), and the high technicalities in installing adaptation tools significantly affect individuals' tendency to adopt long-term coping strategies.","[Ume, Chukwuma Otum] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Onah, Ogochukwu; Adeosun, Kehinde Paul; Nnamdi, Onyekwe Chris; Ihedioha, Nice Nneoma; Onyia, Chukwuemeka] Univ Nigeria, Environm & Resource Econ, Nsukka, Nigeria; [Idika, Ezinne Orie] Univ Nigeria, Dept Social Sci Educ, Nsukka, Nigeria",University of Leeds; University of Nigeria; University of Nigeria,"Idika, EO (corresponding author), Univ Nigeria, Dept Social Sci Educ, Nsukka, Nigeria.",ezinne.idika@unn.edu.ng,"ume, chukwuma/AAE-6608-2022","ume, chukwuma/0000-0003-2033-0560; Adeosun, Kehinde Paul/0000-0002-8061-5851; Idika, Ezinne Orie/0000-0001-8362-1512",,,,,34,3,3,0,6,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1948-8327,1948-8335,,WEATHER CLIM SOC,Weather Clim.

Crop models are the primary tools available to assess the impacts of climate change and other drivers on crop productivity, a key aspect of food security. This review examines their role and suitability for informing climate change adaptation decisions in the SSA context. Perception of climate change is rarely the only factor leading to changed farming practices, with labor availability, recent extreme climatic events (floods or droughts) and access to formal credit, constituting the main factors farmers respond to. Further, farmers' socio-economic status constrains the adaptations they make in response to these drivers. Many crop modeling studies reviewed investigating climate change adaptation currently do not capture many of these drivers, adaptations nor constraints. However, a number of areas were identified where crop models could aid in adaptations decision-making. For instance, crop models can: test which changes farmers are making are most robust to future climate scenarios; be used as tools for experimentation in farmer organizations to build farmer capacity, minimize risk and empower farmers; be linked to economic, farm systems or livestock models to widen the scope of potential impacts, adaptations and farmer constraints considered, and to probe the interactions of cropping systems with other systems; and evaluate various indicators of resilience. Finally it is suggested that one of the greatest benefits of linking crop models across disciplines and in integrated assessment frameworks may be providing a platform to bring specialists and stakeholders from diverse backgrounds together to assess climate change adaptation options to enhance food security in SSA.

Existing neoliberal climate adaptation responses, which often entrench inequality, are unlikely to succeed in informal settlements. The current groundswell of demands for social justice provide the needed impetus for exploring and experimenting with what adaptation might look like in informal settlements. This contribution suggests two areas for careful consideration when applying climate urbanism concepts to informal settlement contexts, namely (1) the temporal tension between adapting to climate change risk and simultaneously having to deal with other, perhaps more immediate, risks, and (2) the use of the concept of transformative adaptation to guide practice-based collaborative interventions.","[Ziervogel, Gina] Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Ziervogel, G (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa.",gina@csag.uct.ac.za,,,AXA Research Fund,AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund),This work was supported by the AXA Research Fund.,,17,10,10,6,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0272-3638,1938-2847,,URBAN GEOGR,Urban Geogr.,JUL 3,2021,42,6,,,,,733,737,,10.1080/02723638.2020.1850629,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2020.1850629,,NOV 2020,5,Geography; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography; Urban Studies,WM6IT,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000590650400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate change is likely to exacerbate this stress. An integrated approach to disaster risk management (DRM) and climate change adaptation (CCA) could reduce the stress by encouraging the more efficient use of pooled resources and expertise. A comparative analysis of three extreme climate-related events that occurred in Australia between 2009 and 2011 indicated that a strategy to improve interagency communication and collaboration would be a key factor in this type of policy/planning integration. These findings are in accord with the concepts of Joined-up Government and Network Governance. Five key reforms are proposed: developing a shared policy vision; adopting multi-level planning; integrating legislation; networking organisations; and establishing cooperative funding. These reforms are examined with reference to the related research literature in order to identify potential problems associated with their implementation. The findings are relevant for public policy generally but are particularly useful for CCA and DRM.","[Howes, Michael; Tangney, Peter; Reis, Kimberley; Burton, Paul] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Howes, Michael; Tangney, Peter; Reis, Kimberley; Burton, Paul] Griffith Univ, Urban Res Program, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Howes, Michael; Tangney, Peter; Reis, Kimberley; Burton, Paul] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Gold Coast, Australia; [Howes, Michael; Tangney, Peter; Reis, Kimberley; Burton, Paul] Griffith Univ, Urban Res Program, Gold Coast, Australia; [Grant-Smith, Deanna] Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Heazle, Michael] Griffith Univ, Griffith Asia Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Heazle, Michael] Griffith Univ, Sch Govt & Int Relat, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Bosomworth, Karyn] RMIT Univ, Climate Change Adaptat Program, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Bosomworth, Karyn] RMIT Univ, Global Cities Res Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Griffith University; Griffith University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Howes, M (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",m.howes@griffith.edu.au,"Tangney, Peter/O-2153-2015; Reis, Kimberley/AAE-8779-2019; Howes, Michael/S-2804-2019; Grant-Smith, Deanna/I-3463-2019; Bosomworth, Karyn/A-6435-2016","Tangney, Peter/0000-0003-3878-4034; Reis, Kimberley/0000-0002-6713-1908; Howes, Michael/0000-0003-1102-1483; Grant-Smith, Deanna/0000-0001-5935-2690; Bosomworth, Karyn/0000-0001-9907-0858; Burton, Paul/0000-0002-6092-0779",,,,,120,82,84,3,135,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

However, since it was introduced water systems have become more complicated due to changes in the global water cycle as a result of climate change. The realization that climate change will have a significant impact on water availability and flood risks has driven research and policy making on adaptation. This paper discusses the main similarities and differences between climate change adaptation and IWRM. The main difference between the two is the focus on current and historic issues of IWRM compared to the (long-term) future focus of adaptation. One of the main problems of implementing climate change adaptation is the large uncertainties in future projections. Two completely different approaches to adaptation have been developed in response to these large uncertainties. A top-down approach based on large scale biophysical impacts analyses focussing on quantifying and minimizing uncertainty by using a large range of scenarios and different climate and impact models. The main problem with this approach is the propagation of uncertainties within the modelling chain. The opposite is the bottom up approach which basically ignores uncertainty. It focusses on reducing vulnerabilities, often at local scale, by developing resilient water systems. Both these approaches however are unsuitable for integrating into water management. The bottom up approach focuses too much on socioeconomic vulnerability and too little on developing (technical) solutions. The top-down approach often results in an explosion of uncertainty and therefore complicates decision making. A more promising direction of adaptation would be a risk based approach. Future research should further develop and test an approach which starts with developing adaptation strategies based on current and future risks. These strategies should then be evaluated using a range of future scenarios in order to develop robust adaptation measures and strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we focused on environmental changes, that is, natural disasters and human activities, in the Poyang Lake Basin over the past 2000 years, to analyze interactions between land use cover changes and human activities from the perspective of regional sustainable development. We collected historical records of climate and hydrology, floods and droughts, and rivers and lakes in the Poyang Lake area, and established time sequences for the floods and droughts, lake water level and lake area, amount of farming land, and population, in order to discuss interactions between changes in the environment and the climate, with emphasis on the impacts of extreme events on lake and river basin environment changes. The following results were obtained. First, climate changes in historical periods had wide-ranging and far-reaching impacts on agricultural production, especially disasters caused by climate change. Among the changes in the Poyang Lake basin environment, including river network systems, lake water levels, etc., changes in lake water volume are direct evidence of climate change, adaptation to climate change, and obvious phased characteristics. Second, in the process of changes to the lake and river network in the Poyang Lake Basin, social and economic development is accompanied by evolution of the lake. Increases and decreases in population, the scale of agricultural production, and lake environment changes have direct and significant interactions. Third, the Poyang Lake basin's environmental changes during the historical period are mainly reflected in the pressure feedback mode of population-agriculture in the lake environment.","[He, Maofeng; Bu, Fengxian; Xie, Jialin] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Northwest Inst Hist Environm & Socioecon Dev, Xian 710119, Peoples R China; [Delang, Claudio O.] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ye, Quan] East China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Hongfei] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Xianyang, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Hongfei; He, Qilin] Chinese Acad Sci & Minist Water Resources, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [He, Wenming] Jiaying Univ, Sch Chem & Environm, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Conservat & Precis Utiliza, Meizhou 514015, Peoples R China","Shaanxi Normal University; Hong Kong Baptist University; East China Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Northwest A&F University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Ministry of Water Resources; Jiaying University","Bu, FX (corresponding author), Shaanxi Normal Univ, Northwest Inst Hist Environm & Socioecon Dev, Xian 710119, Peoples R China.;He, WM (corresponding author), Jiaying Univ, Sch Chem & Environm, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Conservat & Precis Utiliza, Meizhou 514015, Peoples R China.",bfengxian@hotmail.com; hwmjim@163.com,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [18BZS154]; Key Platforms and Scientific Research Projects in Universities in Guangdong Province of China [2018KTSCX212]; Guangdong Rural Science and Technology Commissioner Project of China [163-2019-XMZC-0009-02-0065],National Social Science Foundation of China; Key Platforms and Scientific Research Projects in Universities in Guangdong Province of China; Guangdong Rural Science and Technology Commissioner Project of China,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research was funded by the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 18BZS154), Key Platforms and Scientific Research Projects in Universities in Guangdong Province of China (Grant No. 2018KTSCX212), and Guangdong Rural Science and Technology Commissioner Project of China (163-2019-XMZC-0009-02-0065).",,38,2,2,11,59,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0959-6836,1477-0911,,HOLOCENE,Holocene,FEB,2022,32,1-2,,,,,17,28,9.59683621104778E+015,10.1177/09596836211047777,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836211047777,,OCT 2021,12,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,YC2NP,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000713090900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We documented and illustrated the use of a data collection and analysis suite, SenseMaker, that was designed to collect and work with narrative fragments. The approach presented adds a new and inherently mixed tool to the mixed methods toolbox. Despite its novelty and potential utility, little has been written in the academic literature on the application of SenseMaker to complex problems. To the best of our knowledge, the approach has not been used in relation to climate change or climate change adaptation and has not been presented in the mixed methods literature. We sought to contribute to filling this gap through describing the approach used to generate the data that underpin the articles in this special feature. Our purpose was to illustrate some of the potential and most notable challenges of using the SenseMaker data collection and analysis process in a complex domain through examining adaptation to climate change. Our overview was not exhaustive but rather sought to highlight capabilities and challenges through examining experiences of adaptation from a stages of change perspective. SenseMaker provides a remarkably powerful tool for the capture of micronarratives of complex phenomena such as climate change. The capacity to have respondents interpret, i.e., make sense of, their own narratives is an important innovation that provides one plausible solution to the problem of analysts coding narratives. Analytically, however, SenseMaker is relatively weak for those seeking strong statistical support for analyses and provides no capability for analyzing the narratives themselves.","[Lynam, Timothy] CSIRO, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Lynam, Timothy] Reflecting Soc, Washington, DC USA; [Lynam, Timothy] James Cook Univ, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Fletcher, Chris] Emerging Opt, London, England",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); James Cook University,"Lynam, T (corresponding author), CSIRO, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",,,,CSIRO's Climate Adaptation Flagship,CSIRO's Climate Adaptation Flagship,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the support and assistance of staff and students from the University of the Sunshine Coast in relation to collecting data at the NCCARF conference.

J,"Hamlet, AF",,,,"Hamlet, A. F.",,,Assessing water resources adaptive capacity to climate change impacts in the Pacific Northwest Region of North America,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,COLUMBIA RIVER-BASIN; WASHINGTON-STATE; MANAGEMENT; SNOWPACK; MARKETS; SYSTEM; USA,"Climate change impacts in Pacific Northwest Region of North America (PNW) are projected to include increasing temperatures and changes in the seasonality of precipitation (increasing precipitation in winter, decreasing precipitation in summer). Changes in precipitation are also spatially varying, with the northwestern parts of the region generally experiencing greater increases in cool season precipitation than the southeastern parts. These changes in climate are projected to cause loss of snowpack and associated streamflow timing shifts which will increase cool season (October-March) flows and decrease warm season (April-September) flows and water availability. Hydrologic extremes such as the 100 yr flood and extreme low flows are also expected to change, although these impacts are not spatially homogeneous and vary with mid-winter temperatures and other factors. These changes have important implications for natural ecosystems affected by water, and for human systems. The PNW is endowed with extensive water resources infrastructure and well-established and well-funded management agencies responsible for ensuring that water resources objectives (such as water supply, water quality, flood control, hydropower production, environmental services, etc.) are met. Likewise, access to observed hydrological, meteorological, and climatic data and forecasts is in general exceptionally good in the United States and Canada, and is often supported by federally funded programs that ensure that these resources are freely available to water resources practitioners, policy makers, and the general public. Access to these extensive resources support the argument that at a technical level the PNW has high capacity to deal with the potential impacts of natural climate variability on water resources. To the extent that climate change will manifest itself as moderate changes in variability or extremes, we argue that existing water resources infrastructure and institutional arrangements provide a reasonably solid foundation for coping with climate change impacts, and that the mandates of existing water resources policy and water resources management institutions are at least consistent with the fundamental objectives of climate change adaptation. A deeper inquiry into the underlying nature of PNW water resources systems, however, reveals significant and persistent obstacles to climate change adaptation, which will need to be overcome if effective use of the region's extensive water resources management capacity can be brought to bear on this problem. Primary obstacles include assumptions of stationarity as the fundamental basis of water resources system design, entrenched use of historical records as the sole basis for planning, problems related to the relatively short time scale of planning, lack of familiarity with climate science and models, downscaling procedures, and hydrologic models, limited access to climate change scenarios and hydrologic products for specific water systems, and rigid water allocation and water resources operating rules that effectively block adaptive response. Institutional barriers include systematic loss of technical capacity in many water resources agencies following the dam building era, jurisdictional fragmentation affecting response to drought, disconnections between water policy and practice, and entrenched bureaucratic resistance to change in many water management agencies. These factors, combined with a federal agenda to block climate change policy in the US during the Bush administration have (with some exceptions) contributed to widespread institutional gridlock in the PNW over the last decade or so despite a growing awareness of climate change as a significant threat to water management. In the last several years, however, significant progress has been made in surmounting some of these obstacles, and the region's water resources agencies at all levels of governance are making progress in addressing the fundamental challenges inherent in adapting to climate change.","[Hamlet, A.

Though there is increasing recognition of the challenges that flow from private property rights for effective, long term adaptation planning, there is yet to be sustained and systematic attention to how property rights act as a mechanism that entrenches maladaptive tendencies by further embedding path dependency. This is complicated by law, which on the one hand is thought of as a vehicle to help institutionalise adaptative capacity, but on the other embodies and amplifies property rights. Property discourses are embedding a dominant property rights path dependency for coastal climate adaptation. This path dependency entrenches an incremental approach to coastal governance, with normative ideas on private property rights and the path de-pendencies they create, underpinning managed retreat theory and action. Lessons from case studies in coastal locations in Australia provide important insights into future behaviours of property owners. These insights are useful as coastal management strategies seek to embrace climate change adaptation, and as the financial sector reassesses climate risk exposure.","[O'Donnell, Tayanah] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, Australia",Australian National University,"O'Donnell, T (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, Australia.",tayanah.odonnell@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,124,0,0,3,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,JAN 1,2023,231,,,,,,,,106379,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106379,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106379,,,9,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Oceanography; Water Resources,6C9OE,,Bronze,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000882333000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Presently, it is unclear what approaches are used in the existing policies to cope with the future climatic changes. Our research framework consists of two components. First, we identify and define key characteristics of adaptation policy approaches based on a review of scientific journal articles. The key characteristics identified are institutional flexibility, adaptive nature, scalability and reflexivity. Second, we analyse the presence of these characteristics in the climate change adaptation policies of Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. Our findings show that the four South Asian countries contribute to only 8% of the total journal articles on adaptation policy, with least papers representing Pakistan and Nepal. Reviewing the adaptation policies, we find that except for the Climate Change Policy of Nepal, none of the policies discusses transboundary scale adaptation approaches. The identified adaptation policies lack focus on shared transboundary resources between the countries, and instead focus at national or sub-national scale. This is reflected by relatively low scores for the scalability characteristic. All the countries show high scores for institutional flexibility, suggesting that changing roles and responsibilities between government agencies for adaptation planning and implementation is accepted in the four countries.

In addition to smallholders' autonomous adaptations, policy-makers need to consider how to make sound government interventions to help smallholders effectively adapt to climate change. This study aims to explore how smallholders adapt to climate change under government interventions, and in turn provide recommendations for the government to better promote smallholder adaptation. To achieve this purpose, 1552 household survey data were collected in four agro-pastoral regions of the Tibetan Plateau (TP). A machine learning approach (boosted regression tree, BRT) was used to explore the factors influencing the adaption strategies of smallholders to climate change, especially the role of government interventions in this process. The results show that the smallholders mainly adopted four adaptation strategies (off-home activities, nature reclaiming farmland, raising more livestock, and crop management), while local governments helped them by providing subsidies, training, credit, insurance, and improved varieties; building roads and irrigation facilities; and organizing cooperatives. The results of the BRT model show that the natural capital indicators (elevation, farmland area) were still important factors influencing the smallholders' adoption of adaptation strategies, because natural capital reflects the livelihood basis of smallholders to some extent. The results also suggest that government interventions such as subsidies, cooperatives, and training played an important role in this process. Based on these results, we propose targeted policy recommendations to help local governments improve existing government interventions and to provide lessons for governments in other regions or countries to plan government interventions to promote smallholder adaptation.","[He, Xinjun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610000, Peoples R China; [He, Xinjun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yan, Jianzhong; Wu, Ya; Zhou, Hong] Southwest Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, State Cultivat Base Ecoagr Southwest Mountainous L, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Yang, Liang Emily] Ludwig Maximilian Univ ofltib Munich, Dept Geog, Munich, Germany; [Yan, Jianzhong] Southwest Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, 1 Tiansheng Rd, Chongqing 400716, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Mountain Hazards & Environment, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Southwest University - China; Southwest University - China","Yan, JZ (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, 1 Tiansheng Rd, Chongqing 400716, Peoples R China.",yanjz@swu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [42171098]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0603]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20040201],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42171098) , the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (No. 2019QZKK0603) , and the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. XDA20040201) .

Smallholder farmers are the most vulnerable, and currently must make production decisions in a high risk and uncertain environment with regard to rainfall and temperature. This paper uses climate and household survey data to analyse farmer perceptions regarding climate change, adaptation measures taken in response to these changes, and how well these perceptions correlate with meteorological data in Kenya. We find that a significant number of farmers perceive climate change as real, and that they are particularly concerned about changes in rainfall and temperature. Changing crop varieties is predominantly used as an adaptation measure since extension messages often encourage adoption of drought-resistant varieties. Major factors influencing farmer perceptions include age of the farmer, which is often associated with more farming experience and subsequent extension service. Except in low potential zones, farmers' perceptions of climatic variability are in line with climatic data records. Better education, access to extension messages, farm size and credit facilities are necessary for farmers to decide to adapt to climate change. The paper further assesses barriers to the adoption of various adaptation strategies, and lack of finances and knowledge have been found to inhibit adaptation response within the smallholder farming sector. Findings imply that effective adaptation to threats posed by climate variability and change requires a multi-dimensional collaborative approach, with different stakeholders playing key roles in providing support services in terms of education, extension, credit and meteorological information.","[Ochieng, Justus] World Vegetable Ctr, Eastern & Southern Africa, Arusha, Tanzania; [Kirimi, Lilian; Makau, Joyce] Tegemeo Inst Agr Policy & Dev, Nairobi, Kenya",,"Ochieng, J (corresponding author), World Vegetable Ctr, Eastern & Southern Africa, Arusha, Tanzania.",justus.ochieng@worldveg.org; lkirimi@tegemeo.org; jmakau@tegemeo.org,,"Justus, Ochieng/0000-0002-6326-1377",,,,,49,28,28,2,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0165-0203,1477-8947,,NAT RESOUR FORUM,Nat.

In the age of climate change, where future disasters are accurately predictable and resulting harm is preventable, the United States should adopt a proactive response to disasters caused by climate change. The United States should create a framework to relocate its most vulnerable communities before recurring or future harm occurs. This Note proposes that a third category of disaster response be added to the Stafford Act for impending climate change disasters, which would trigger certain types of federal grants to assist with relocation of vulnerable communities facing the most critical effects of climate change. The addition of this new category of disaster comports with federalism requirements, preserving states' police power while capitalizing on the informational and financial benefits of a federal role in proactive adaptation to climate change. The grant of a federal impending climate change disaster declaration should be conditioned upon a cost share between states and the federal government and state adoption of climate change adaptation plans. These conditions are constitutional pursuant to the Spending Clause requirements of South Dakota v. Dole, and amending the Stafford Act to include impending climate change disasters does not fundamentally alter an existing conditioned receipt of federal funds such that it is a new program pursuant to National Federation of Independent Business v.

However, little is known about the pathways for its systematic implementation, or the extent to which it is already mainstreamed in municipal planning practice. This article reports on a study in which local pathways to sustainably mainstream ecosystem-based adaptation were compared in 12 municipalities in Germany and Sweden. The results show that while progress is seemingly similar in the two countries, there are noticeable differences regarding the local triggers, the importance given to particular mainstreaming strategies and their link to climate policy integration. Ecosystem-based approaches to climate change adaptation are not labelled or systematised in either country. In addition, the mainstreaming of ecosystem-based adaptation is enabled through municipalities' level of experience in mainstreaming other issues. In Sweden, the ecosystem service concept drives adaptation mainstreaming, which is often disconnected from the integration of climate mitigation policy. In contrast, German structures and planning processes established for climate change mitigation are paving the way. We conclude that systematic adaptation mainstreaming and its potential linkages and disconnects with climate mitigation policy integration require more explicit consideration, both in research and practice. We call for more research on the role of inclusive (as opposed to fragmented) climate policy integration to assure sustainable planning and transformation.","[Wamsler, Christine] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden; [Wamsler, Christine] Ctr Societal Resilience, Lund, Sweden; [Pauleit, Stephan] TUM, Strateg Landscape Planning & Management, Munich, Germany",Lund University; Technical University of Munich,"Wamsler, C (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden.;Wamsler, C (corresponding author), Ctr Societal Resilience, Lund, Sweden.",christine.wamsler@lucsus.lu.se,,"Pauleit, Stephan/0000-0002-0056-6720",Swedish Research Council (FORMAS),Swedish Research Council (FORMAS)(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),"This study was carried out as part of the Sustainable Urban Transformation for Climate Change Adaptation research project funded by the Swedish Research Council (FORMAS).

Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured interviews with twenty-four stakeholders from a diverse cross-section of the Australian property industry were undertaken in 2018 and 2019. Findings A range of barriers to action on climate change were identified. These barriers centre around (1) information: lack of clear, reliable, and trusted sources of climate change information; (2) cost: competing economic demands, and the perceived threat that investing in climate change action poses to competitiveness; and (3) regulation: the inaction of governments thus failing to provide a regulatory environment to address climate change. Research limitations/implications - The qualitative research provides perspectives from actors in different sectors of the Australian property industry. While it provides an in-depth understanding of the barriers to addressing climate change adaptation, it is not necessarily a nationally representative sample. Practical implications - The study identifies barriers to climate change adaptation, and establishes practical ways in which the Australian property industry can address these barriers and the role that government regulation could have in generating industry-wide change. Social implications - Climate change poses significant challenges to society. Built environments are significant contributors to climate change, and thus the property industry is well-placed to make positive contributions to this global challenge. Originality/value Limited research has examined barriers to climate change action in the property industry. This research provides novel insights from the perspective of key actors across a diverse range of property industry sectors. This new knowledge fills an important gap in understanding how to address climate change in Australia and broader contexts.","[Warren-Myers, Georgia; Hurlimann, Anna; Bush, Judy] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Warren-Myers, G (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",g.warrenmyers@unimelb.edu.au; anna.hurlimann@unimelb.edu.au; judy.bush@unimelb.edu.au,"Warren-Myers, Georgia/ABI-1819-2020","Warren-Myers, Georgia/0000-0002-1453-8421; Bush, Judy/0000-0002-7847-6610; Hurlimann, Anna/0000-0001-9110-9340","Faculty of Architecture Building and Planning at the University of Melbourne, Australia","Faculty of Architecture Building and Planning at the University of Melbourne, Australia","We acknowledge the research assistance by Laura Curtoni with data analysis and Jenny Pitts identifying potential interviewees.

Meanwhile, communities in Batutegi are also suggesting that effects of climate change are becoming more prominent in their region. Indicators include rising air temperature and the increasing regularity of extreme weather changes. Studies show that land cover has decreased by up to 95% in the region. As these trends intensify, predictions note that the Batutegi reservoir and the productivity of the surrounding protected forests will be affected. This research examines FMU efforts to adapt to vulnerabilities from environmental and climate change. The broader objective of this research is to determine the appropriate climate change adaptation efforts, specifically regarding the management of sustainable forest protection. The method is conducted through regression analysis to identify significant variables and applies the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to identify priorities for planned interventions for climate change adaptation by the FMU. Based on regression results there were four significant variables, i.e. appropriate agroforestry initiatives, non-timber forest products, community institutional support, and local policy engagement. This research also considers various kinds of technologies of adaptation applied by local communities. Examining community efforts also presents possibilities for improving FMU institutional planning that is locally responsive. This is done primarily through agroforestry techniques and other community conservation practices. Based on the result of the AHP analysis, the findings highlight various programs related to agroforestry technologies as the top priority. Thereafter, priorities point to institutional development policies. Together, these priorities can form the basic considerations for developing climate change adaptation policies in Batutegi. These policies can be applied with, and by communities in managing forests through agroforestry, beginning with support for high quality seed procurement that also supports all phases of cultivation and supply chain through final product marketing. As a result, forest productivity and support for local income can form a robust approach for fulfilling community needs despite the effects of environmental and climate change in Batutegi.","[Wulandari, Christine] Lampung Univ, Grad Program Forestry, Bandar Lampung, Indonesia",Universitas Lampung,"Wulandari, C (corresponding author), Lampung Univ, Grad Program Forestry, Bandar Lampung, Indonesia.",christine.wulandari@fp.unila.ac.id,,"Wulandari, Christine/0000-0003-2667-4911",,,,,45,2,2,0,2,"MAKASSAR, FAK KEHUTANAN UNIV HASANUDDIN",MAKASSAR,"JALAN PERINTIS KEMERDEKAAN KM 10, MAKASSAR, 90245, INDONESIA",2549-4724,2549-4333,,FOR SOC,For.

The findings reveal that the years 2006-07 represent a turning point, after which climate change studies appear more prominently and consistently in the urban planning and design literature; however, the majority of these studies address climate change mitigation rather than adaptation. Most adaptation studies deal with governance, social learning, and vulnerability assessments, while paying little attention to physical planning and urban design interventions.

After providing an overview of the history of pathway approaches, the paper focuses on four approaches that apply the metaphor of pathways differently: the socioeconomic pathways, dynamic adaptive policy pathways, pathways to resilience, and the social, technology, and environmental pathways to sustainability. Lessons and strengths from each of these approaches are highlighted. Utilizing multiple pathway approaches can further aid in creating useful and usable knowledge.

However, measuring municipalities' adaptation progress presents its share of difficulties especially when it comes to comparing (on similar dimensions and over time) the situation of different municipal entities and to linking adaptation impacts to local actions. Longitudinal studies with recurring indicators could capture changes occurring over time, but the development of such indicators requires great emphasis on methodological and psychometric aspects, such as measurement validity. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and validate an index of adaptation to heatwaves and flooding at the level of municipal urbanists and urban planners. Methods: A sample of 139 officers working in urbanism and urban planning for municipal entities in the province of Quebec (Canada) completed an online questionnaire. Developed based on a literature review and consultation of representatives from the municipal sector, the questionnaire measured whether the respondent's municipal entity did or did not adopt the behaviors that are recommended in the scientific and gray literature to adapt to heatwaves and flooding. Results: Results of the various metrological analyses (indicator reliability analysis, first order confirmatory factor analysis, concurrent validity analysis, and nomological validity assessment analysis) confirmed the validity of the index developed to measure progress in climate change adaptation at the municipal level. The first dimension of the index corresponds to preliminary measures that inform and prepare stakeholders for action (i.e., groundwork adaptation initiatives), whereas the second refers to measures that aim to concretely reduce vulnerability to climate change, to improve the adaptive capacity or the resilience of human and natural systems (i.e., adaptation actions). Conclusion: The results of a series of psychometric analyses showed that the index has good validity and could properly measure the adoption of actions to prepare for adaptation as well as adaptation actions per se. Municipal and government officials can therefore consider using it to monitor and evaluate adaptation efforts at the municipal level.","[Jacob, Johann; Valois, Pierre; Tessier, Maxime] Univ Laval, Fac Sci Educ, Observ Quebecois Adaptat Changements Climat OQAC, 2320 Rue Bibliotheques, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",Laval University,"Jacob, J (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Fac Sci Educ, Observ Quebecois Adaptat Changements Climat OQAC, 2320 Rue Bibliotheques, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",johann.jacob@fse.ulaval.ca,,,Climate Change Action Plan (PACC 2013-2020) - Institut national de sante publique du Quebec (INSPQ),Climate Change Action Plan (PACC 2013-2020) - Institut national de sante publique du Quebec (INSPQ),"We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the 2013-2020 Climate Change Action Plan (PACC 2013-2020), funded by the Institut national de sante publique du Quebec (INSPQ).

Climate change is expected to influence many of these hazards. Thus, climate-related risks over South Asia make disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) key policy goals. Recently there is an increasing consensus that DRR including CCA should be embedded in development planning. Disaster risk reduction including CCA has progressively gained importance in global governance. Across South Asia, however, such integration is only in a preliminary stage. This review was to assess the existing status and scope of DRR including CCA in development projects across South Asia, so that an effective and achievable deliberation may be made to regional policymakers. A total of 371 projects relevant to CCA and DRR were reviewed. The project inventory was diverse in nature with respect to location, scale, sectoral focus, and strategic importance. Bangladesh, India, and Bhutan were observed to be proactive in implementing DRR- and CCA-related projects. Meta-analysis of the project inventory suggests an urgent need for an individual and collaborative convergence of processes for DRR and CCA through policies, plans, strategies, and programs.","[Mall, Rajesh K.; Srivastava, Ravindra K.; Banerjee, Tirthankar; Bhatt, Diva; Sonkar, Geetika] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Mall, Rajesh K.; Srivastava, Ravindra K.; Banerjee, Tirthankar; Sonkar, Geetika] Banaras Hindu Univ, DST Mahamana Ctr Excellence Climate Change Res, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Srivastava, Ravindra K.] Minist Home Affairs, New Delhi 110001, India; [Mishra, Om Prakash] Minist Earth Sci, New Delhi 110003, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India,"Mall, RK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.;Mall, RK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, DST Mahamana Ctr Excellence Climate Change Res, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",mall_raj@rediffmail.com,"mall, rajesh kumar/AAG-2989-2020; SONKAR, GEETIKA/AAD-6081-2019","mall, rajesh kumar/0000-0002-3118-096X; SONKAR, GEETIKA/0000-0002-0481-818X","SAARC Disaster Management Centre, New Delhi; United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR); Climate Change Programme, Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi, India","SAARC Disaster Management Centre, New Delhi; United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR); Climate Change Programme, Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi, India","The authors are thankful to the SAARC Disaster Management Centre, New Delhi; the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR); and the Climate Change Programme, Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi, India for support to this study.

This study concentrated on reviewing progress made in understanding the relationship between the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus and climate change adaptation, using Africa as a case study. The method used to achieve this objective was the bibliometric analysis, covering the period from 1980-2021. Data used for this study were acquired from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases. Initially, 95 documents were retrieved from the WoS and Scopus core collection databases, but 30 duplicates were removed, and 65 documents were used. The outputs were further analysed using the bibliometric R package and VOS viewer. Analysis of the top 100 keywords in the 65 publications that link WEF nexus with climate change adaptation for Africa showed that 46 keywords fall under the application of WEF nexus, 31 keywords under the implementation of WEF nexus and 23 keywords under the implication of WEF nexus. Researchers from countries around the world have published the WEF nexus work undertaken on the African continent. Countries with the highest number of publications were South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Germany, Kenya and Zimbabwe. Thematic analysis was used to explore the conceptual structure of WEF publications, and it produced four themes: (i) well-established concepts appropriate for structuring the conceptual framework of the field of WEF nexus in Africa; (ii) strongly developed concepts but still marginal for the field of WEF nexus in Africa; (iii) not fully developed or marginally interesting concepts for the field of WEF nexus in Africa, and (iv) significant cross-cutting concepts in the field of WEF nexus in Africa in relation to climate change adaptation. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on the WEF nexus by pointing out dominant themes from those that are still emerging in the scholarly work done in Africa.","[Adeola, Omolola M.; Ramoelo, Abel] Univ Pretoria, Ctr Environm Studies, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa; [Mantlana, Brian; Mokotedi, Oscar] Council Sci & Ind Res CSIR, Meiring Naude Rd, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Silwana, Wongalethu; Tsele, Philemon] Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria; University of Pretoria,"Adeola, OM; Ramoelo, A (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Ctr Environm Studies, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa.",lolaadisa@yahoo.com; abel.ramoelo@up.ac.za,"Tsele, Philemon/HMV-4767-2023","Tsele, Philemon/0000-0003-0765-7905; Ramoelo, Abel/0000-0002-9917-9754",Water Research Commission in South Africa,Water Research Commission in South Africa,This manuscript is part of a project that is funded by the Water Research Commission in South Africa.,,45,1,1,7,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2022,14,20,,,,,,,13672,10.3390/su142013672,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142013672,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,5Q0HZ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000873523000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Immediate economic challenges often prevent the establishment of long-term collective strategies. However, collective decisions on a communal level regarding land use are crucial for CCA strategies, given the interdependencies of farming with forestry, tourism, and other economic sectors, especially in mountain areas. This paper presents inter- and trans-disciplinary learning processes, which have evolved into a project modelling the hydrological effects of combined future climate and land-use changes based on the combined scenarios of climate and socio-economic change in an Alpine valley (Brixental in Tyrol/Austria). Locally adapted scenarios illustrate future land-use changes as a result of both climate change and different socio-economic developments. The hydrological results show how an increase in the forested area reduces streamflow (as a measure of water availability) in the long term. For local stakeholders, the process demonstrated clearly the interdependence of different economic sectors and the necessity for collective action at a regional level to influence socio-economic development. Moreover, it made them aware that local decisions on future land use may influence the effects of climate change. Consistent storylines helped stakeholders to visualize a desired future and to see their scope of influence. The transdisciplinary research process allowed local stakeholders to translate the hydrological modelling results into a concrete local CCA strategy.","[Schermer, Markus; Stotten, Rike] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Sociol, Mt Agr Res Unit, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Strasser, Ulrich; Meissl, Gertraud; Marke, Thomas] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Geog, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Foerster, Kristian] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Hydrol & Water Resources Management, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Formayer, Herbert] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Meteorol, A-1180 Vienna, Austria","University of Innsbruck; University of Innsbruck; Leibniz University Hannover; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Schermer, M (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Dept Sociol, Mt Agr Res Unit, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",markus.schermer@uibk.ac.at; rike.stotten@uibk.ac.at; ulrich.strasser@uibk.ac.at; gertraud.meissl@uibk.ac.at; thomas.marke@uibk.ac.at; foerster@iww.uni-hannover.de; herbert.formayer@boku.ac.at,"Förster, Kristian/I-3813-2019; Meißl, Gertraud/L-9216-2019; Marke, Thomas/B-6466-2018","Förster, Kristian/0000-0001-7542-2820; Meißl, Gertraud/0000-0001-9122-3207; Schermer, Markus/0000-0002-0392-9072; Marke, Thomas/0000-0003-1700-4115; Strasser, Ulrich/0000-0003-4776-2822; Stotten, Rike/0000-0002-6193-8233","Austrian Climate Research Program of the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund [KR13AC6K11109, ACRP6]",Austrian Climate Research Program of the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund,"This research was funded by the Austrian Climate Research Program of the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund (project STELLA KR13AC6K11109, ACRP6).",,62,7,7,2,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,NOV,2018,8,11,,,,,,,237,10.3390/agronomy8110237,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy8110237,,,18,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,HB7ZF,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000451301100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Comprehensive multi-sectoral adaptation strategies have emerged as the preferred approach across Europe. The German Adaptation Strategy is a prominent example for such a comprehensive strategy. It addresses 14 sectors with national key issues and measures, and it provides orientation for other (mainly sub-national) actors. Against this trend, the Netherlands has pursued climate change adaptation mainly through a sectorally focused approach: the Dutch Delta Programme. Building on existing programmes,Governments in many it facilitates analysis and strategy development for long-term water management at a national scale with a strong regional focus. The present paper compares the two dissimilar governance approaches mainly with regard to how and to what degree they mainstream adaptation into water and coastal zone management in selected regions. After discussing strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, we conclude that the more common multi-sectoral approach applied in Germany and most other OECD countries is not necessarily superior to sectorally focused approaches. Although the Dutch and the German cases appear to resemble alternatives, we highlight that their combination holds the promise to compensate for each other's weaknesses. Overall, we argue that diversity in the governance of climate change adaptation is desirable because it can help to prevent that several countries fail in similar ways.","[Bauer, Anja; Steurer, Reinhard] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Steurer, R (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Vienna, Austria.",reinhard.steurer@boku.ac.at,"Bauer, Anja/X-5362-2019","Bauer, Anja/0000-0003-2197-1925; Steurer, Reinhard/0000-0002-5000-7046",Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP) [K09AC0K00032],Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP),"We thank the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP) for funding the Go-Adapt project (Project No. K09AC0K00032), Judith Feichtinger for her contribution to the Dutch case study, and two reviewers for their constructive comments that helped us to improve the paper.",,54,16,16,2,35,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Marine spatial planning has been widely hailed as a means of improving ocean governance through holistic ecosystem-based planning. However, that concept arose without reference to climate change, and hence it does not automatically account for the dynamic alterations in marine ecosystems that climate change is bringing. This Article attempts to adapt marine spatial planning to climate change adaptation. In so doing, it explores three main topics. First, it examines how established marine protected areas can aid climate change adaptation. Second, it looks at how nations have incorporated climate change considerations into marine spatial planning to increase marine ecosystem resilience, focusing on the international leader in marine spatial planning: Australia. Finally, the Article explores how marine spatial planning could become flexible enough to adapt to the changes that climate change will bring to the world's oceans, focusing on anticipatory zoning. Governments, of course, can establish marine zoning governance regimes in anticipation of climate change impacts, as has already occurred in the Arctic. However, drawing on work by Josh Eagle, Barton H. Thompson, and James Sanchirico, this Article argues that governments could also combine anticipatory zoning and comprehensively regulated marine use rights bidding regimes to encourage potential future private users to make informed bets about the figure productivity value of different parts of the ocean, potentially improving both our ability to anticipate climate change impacts on particular marine environments and the ocean governance regimes for climate-sensitive areas.","Univ Utah, SJ Quinney Coll Law, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Craig, RK (corresponding author), Univ Utah, SJ Quinney Coll Law, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",robin.craig@law.utah.edu,"Craig, Robin Kundis/GPX-3135-2022; Craig, Robin Kundis/U-7318-2018","Craig, Robin Kundis/0000-0003-2120-9543; Craig, Robin Kundis/0000-0003-2120-9543",,,,,126,18,18,1,49,HARVARD LAW SCHOOL,CAMBRIDGE,"PUBLICATIONS CTR, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA",0147-8257,,,HARVARD ENVIRON LAW,Harv.

We use the heat mitigation potential of greenspace and the case of Taipei Metropolis in Taiwan to assess challenges arising from thinking about fairness in terms of distribution of benefits from greenspace functions, as opposed to fairness in greenspace accessibility and availability. Urban greening to foster 'resilient' communities arguably deflects from - or even exacerbates - structural causes of vulnerability, with benefits accruing disproportionately to more affluent or empowered groups. Yet the need for practical action on climate threats in cities is urgent, and for heat, strategic greenspace use considered systematically across a city may mitigate effects through the cooling effect of vegetation. The challenge is thus to balance the justice concerns associated with urban greening with this tangible risk reduction potential. We undertake content analysis of articles from two Taiwanese newspapers - the Taipei Times and the China Post - to assess how heat and greenspace issues have been discussed in urban governance debates within Taipei. We suggest change adaptation through urban greening raises three challenges for equity thinking: (a) guiding planning and governance processes with scientific understanding of how green space functions are delivered, even in the face of urban development pressures and site-specific controversies; (b) tempering the social cohesion and practical deployment benefits of neighbourhood-level greening with the need for specific understanding at the city-wide level to most effectively realise ecosystem services; and (c) linking targeted adaptation actions with broader rationales for urban greening, whilst not diluting justice concerns. We caution that pragmatism towards all urban climate adaptation via greening as intrinsically 'good' must not serve as a blinder to the need for accompanying social policy measures to reduce unequal vulnerability to climate risks.

Similarly, only limited studies have acknowledged the significance of local food choices, providing a model for global responses to climate change.

Considering the influence of port as the middle-man of global trade and development, this study undertakes semantic, co-authorship, and geographic coverage analyses of major articles on port climate change adaptation to shed light on the evolution of research over last fifteen years. With semantic analyses, we extract material words and expressions of identified articles, based on their title and keywords, and discuss when they have been taken into consideration and how they have been jointly studied. Also, co-authorship analysis shows the formation and expansion of research communities. Finally, geographic coverage of research and geographic distribution of researchers explain to what extent this subject has been explored and knowledge has been disseminated around the globe. We hereby suggest that future research should claim adaptation leadership by a quick paradigm shift, to support timely decisions. It is time to move ahead, focusing more on adaptation actions and approaches to bridge adaptation gaps.","[Panahi, Roozbeh; Ng, Adolf K.

However, within government, the hierarchical and mechanistic design of bureaucratic agencies is often not well suited to this task. As a result, governments have increasingly implemented mechanisms encouraging interagency collaboration to better address complex environmental governance challenges, an example being climate change adaptation. In this article, we take an inside look' at how civil servants, working in the government agencies responsible for progressing climate change adaptation strategies, view collaboration and draw on science-based knowledge to inform decision-making. Focusing on civil servants in agencies from the states of Victoria, Australia, and New York, the USA, and the province of British Columbia, Canada, the results show variation across jurisdictions in terms of the collaborative mechanisms used. However, respondents in all three jurisdictions reported remarkably consistent views on the importance of collaboration and scientific knowledge to their role. Overall, our results suggest a gap exists between the motivation of civil servants to collaborate and draw on scientific information and their capacity/ability to do so, pointing to potential institutional and systemic barriers that require further research.","[Temby, O.] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Polit Sci, Edinburg, TX USA; [Sandall, J.; Hickey, G.

This research assesses the feasibility of using resettlement as climate change adaptation (CCA) in Manila using the 5 Principles for climate-related resettlement developed by Tadgell, Doberstein and Mortsch (2017 forthcoming). Data from key informant interviews (n=27) with resettlement, CCA, and DRR professionals, addresses the topic in three phases. First, it investigates the role of resettlement in existing CCA and DRR projects to understand if movement from environmental hazards is already occurring. Next, the research gathers interviewee perspectives on the applicability of the 5 Principles in relation to Manila's existing resettlement landscape, and identifies any amendments or foreseen challenges to them. Finally, it explores the perceptions of resettlement, DRR, and CCA actors on the feasibility of employing resettlement as CCA in Manila, including any challenges that may impede the strategy. The findings suggest that existing resettlement infrastructure could be enhanced to provide effective CCA as identified by the 5 Principles, such as initiatives with in-city relocation sites and vertical housing. Poverty is the greatest challenge to implementing any successful adaptation strategy, including resettlement. Thus, poverty reduction should the foundation of CCA planning for some urban poor communities in Manila.","[Tadgell, Anne; Mortsch, Linda; Doberstein, Brent] Univ Waterloo, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Tadgell, A (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",atadgell@gmail.com; ldmortsch@uwaterloo.ca; bdoberst@uwaterloo.ca,,,Coastal Cities at Risk: Building Capacity for Managing Climate Change in Coastal Megacities (CCaR) project; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR); International Development Research Council (IDRC) under the International Research Initiative on Adaptation to Climate Change (IRIACC),Coastal Cities at Risk: Building Capacity for Managing Climate Change in Coastal Megacities (CCaR) project; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)CGIAR); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); International Development Research Council (IDRC) under the International Research Initiative on Adaptation to Climate Change (IRIACC),"This collaboration was undertaken as part of work that is supported by the Coastal Cities at Risk: Building Capacity for Managing Climate Change in Coastal Megacities (CCaR) project.

The study was based on multistage sampling techniques to select the study villages and sampled households (HHs). Data were collected through HH survey, focus group discussions and key informant interviews. The collected data were analysed by using descriptive statistics and multinomial logit (MNL) model. The results revealed that in response to the effects of climate variability and change, the adaptation strategies deployed by farmers included terracing as soil and water conservation strategy, changing planting date, fertiliser application, crop diversification with improved variety, income diversification and livestock diversification. The result from MNL analysis showed that age, family size, educational level, farm size, income, livestock holding, access to extension, distance to market, access to climate information and agroecological zones were amongst the factors that had a significant influence on farmers' choice of adaptation strategies. The basic barriers to climate change adaptation were lack of finance, shortage of land, inadequate climate information, lack of skill and shortage of labour. Therefore, strengthening interventions that enhance income generating activities and access to climate information should be an integral part of climate change adaptation strategies. Moreover, providing early maturing and high-value crop varieties that are more suited to the local environment is also crucial.","[Destaw, Fikre] Gambella Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Nat Resource Management, Gambella, Ethiopia; [Fenta, Muluken M.] Hawassa Univ, Wondo Genet Coll Forestry & Nat Resource, Dept Gen Forestry, Hawassa, Ethiopia",Hawassa University,"Fenta, MM (corresponding author), Hawassa Univ, Wondo Genet Coll Forestry & Nat Resource, Dept Gen Forestry, Hawassa, Ethiopia.",mulukenmekuyie@gmail.com,,"Destaw, Fikre/0000-0001-7273-3594; , Muluken Mekuyie Fenta/0000-0002-5948-2273","Ministry of Education, Ethiopia","Ministry of Education, Ethiopia","The authors are grateful to the Ministry of Education, Ethiopia for the financial support offered for this study.",,56,9,9,4,7,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1996-1421,2072-845X,,JAMBA-J DISASTER RIS,Jamba-J.

We report on conceptual and geographic trends within the literature, including the practice of assessing local knowledge against scientific benchmarks, and present results of a textual network analysis that illustrates overlap and co-occurrence among different characterizations of local knowledge. In critically assessing the dominant trends we draw special attention to problems associated with the extraction of local knowledge without due consideration of how this process is embedded and inextricable from local contexts and sociotechnical orders. Drawing on theories of science and technology that examine the ontological politics of research practices, we propose a co-productive path forward for local knowledge mobilization to inform adaptation decision-making, which we argue facilitates the transformation of the institutional and governance arrangement of climate adaptation to provide greater flexibility and experimentalism in research and decision-making.

Few studies have documented the barriers to redressing the drivers of social vulnerability as part of urban local climate change adaptation efforts, or evaluated how emerging adaptation plans impact marginalized groups. Here, we present a roadmap to reorient research on the social dimensions of urban climate adaptation around four issues of equity and justice: (1) broadening participation in adaptation planning; (2) expanding adaptation to rapidly growing cities and those with low financial or institutional capacity; (3) adopting a multilevel and multi-scalar approach to adaptation planning; and (4) integrating justice into infrastructure and urban design processes. Responding to these empirical and theoretical research needs is the first step towards identifying pathways to more transformative adaptation policies.","[Shi, Linda; Debats, Jessica] MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Chu, Eric] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, Nieuwe Achtergracht 127, NL-1018 WS Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Anguelovski, Isabelle] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Aylett, Alexander] Inst Natl Rech Sci, Ctr Urbanisat Culture Soc, 385 Rue Sherbrooke Est, Montreal, PQ H2X 1E3, Canada; [Goh, Kian] Northeastern Univ, Sch Architecture, 360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Schenk, Todd] Virginia Tech, Architecture Annex UAP, Sch Publ & Int Affairs 0113, 140 Otey St NW, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Seto, Karen C.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Dodman, David] Int Inst Environm & Dev, Human Settlements Grp, 80-86 Grays Inn Rd, London WC1X 8NH, England; [Roberts, Debra] eThekwini Municipal, Environm Planning & Climate Protect Dept, POB 680, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa; [Roberts, J.

By coordinating adaptation and disaster risk management policies, multiple benefits can be achieved. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) offers a cost-effective adaptation and DRR at different scales and under multiple scenarios. EbA uses natural or managed ecosystem processes to increase resilience and adaptation to climate change. EbA delivers other benefits, including mitigating greenhouse gases, and improving biodiversity, water and air quality. These co-benefits can be the primary driver for implementation and reflect related policy objectives. EbA are also associated with different land use or habitat types (e.g. agriculture, forestry, coastal, urban, or freshwater ecosystems). This paper considers the lessons learnt from implementing EbA across a range of land uses. However, implementation frequently applies multiple measures across land uses and at varying scales. The evidence indicates that adaptation and DRR are achievable cost-effectively whilst providing important co-benefits. Demonstrating these co-benefits ensures both stakeholder support and funding opportunities. Further, the mainstreaming of nature-based solutions across policy areas linked to different co-benefits both increases the acceptability of EbA and also opens up multiple funding sources. Key to the success of EbA is the involvement of stakeholders throughout the implementation process; this can include demonstrating private benefits and utilising trusted intermediaries. However, gaps often remain in our knowledge of the biophysical and economic benefits, or negative impacts, of EbA indicating that research and monitoring remain a priority.","[McVittie, Alistair; Cole, Lorna] SRUC, West Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland; [Wreford, Anita] Scion, New Zealand Forest Res Inst, Rotorua, New Zealand; [Sgobbi, Alessandra] Directorate Gen Climate Act DG CLIMA, Directorate Int & Mainstreaming Adaptat, European Commiss, Auderghem, Belgium; [Yordi, Beatriz] Directorate Gen Climate Act DG CLIMA, European Commiss, Directorate European & Int Carbon Markets, Auderghem, Belgium",Scion,"McVittie, A (corresponding author), SRUC, West Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland.",alistair.mcvittie@sruc.ac.uk,"McVittie, Alistair/G-7087-2012","McVittie, Alistair/0000-0002-7128-7446; Cole, Lorna/0000-0002-3929-0530",European Commission DG Climate Action project: EU strategy on adaptation to climate change: knowledge assessments [CLIMA.C.3/SER/2015/0007],European Commission DG Climate Action project: EU strategy on adaptation to climate change: knowledge assessments,"The research reported in this paper was funded by the European Commission DG Climate Action project: EU strategy on adaptation to climate change: knowledge assessments (CLIMA.C.3/SER/2015/0007).

Most studies of climate change adaptation consist of narrative descriptions of individual cases or global synthesis, making it difficult to formulate and test locally rooted but generalizable hypotheses about adaptation processes. In contrast, researchers in this study analyzed key points in climate change adaptation derived from coordinated fieldwork in seven coastal communities around the world, including Arctic, temperate, and tropical areas on four continents. Study communities faced multiple challenges from sea level rise and warmer ocean temperatures, including coastal erosion, increasing salinity, and ecological changes. We analyzed how the communities adapted to climate effects and other co-occurring forces for change, focusing on most important changes to local livelihoods and societies, and barriers to and enablers of adaptation. Although many factors contributed to adaptation, communities with strong self-organized local institutions appeared better able to adapt without substantial loss of well-being than communities where these institutions were weak or absent. Key features of these institutions included setting and enforcing rules locally and communication across scales. Self-governing local institutions have been associated with sustainable management of natural resources. In our study communities, analogous institutions played a similar role to moderate adverse effects from climate-driven environmental change. The findings suggest that policies to strengthen, recognize, and accommodate local institutions could improve adaptation outcomes.","[Berman, Matthew] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Inst Social & Econ Res, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Baztan, Juan; Vanderlinden, Jean-Paul; Huctin, Jean-Michel] Univ Versailles St Quentin En Yvelines, 11 Blvd Alembert, F-78280 Guyancourt, France; [Kofinas, Gary] Univ Alaska, POB 757000, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Chouinard, Omer] Univ Moncton, Pavillon Leopold Taillon 18,Ave Antonine Maillet, Moncton, NB E1A 3E9, Canada; [Kane, Alioune] Univ Cheikh Anta Diop, Blvd Martin Luther King,BP 5005, Dakar, Senegal; [Maze, Camille] Ctr Natl Rech Sci Brest, UMR 6539, Lab Sci Environm Marin IUEM, Technopole Brest Iroise,Rue Dumont dUrville, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Nikulina, Inga] North Eastern Fed Univ, Yakutsk, Sakha, Russia; [Thomson, Kaleekal] Cochin Univ Sci & Technol, Cochin 682016, Kerala, India",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Moncton; University Cheikh Anta Diop Dakar; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk; Cochin University Science & Technology,"Berman, M (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Anchorage, Inst Social & Econ Res, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",matthew.berman@uaa.alaska.edu,"Gillette, Amber/AAD-9560-2020","Nikulkina, Inga/0000-0002-2889-1197; Maze, Camille/0000-0001-7451-8310","Belmont Forum International Opportunities Fund; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, France; National Science Foundation, USA; Ministry of Earth Science, India; Russian Foundation for Basic Research, Russia; Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada, Canada","Belmont Forum International Opportunities Fund; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, France(French National Research Agency (ANR)); National Science Foundation, USA(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Ministry of Earth Science, India; Russian Foundation for Basic Research, Russia(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)); Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada, Canada","This research received financial support from the Belmont Forum International Opportunities Fund, with contributions from Agence Nationale de la Recherche, France; National Science Foundation, USA; Ministry of Earth Science, India; Russian Foundation for Basic Research, Russia; and Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada, Canada.",,53,15,15,4,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

There is also increasing recognition of the need not only to adjust management strategies in light of climate shifts, but to reassess and, as needed, modify underlying conservation goals. Major advances in the development of climate-adaptation principles, strategies, and planning processes have occurred over the past few years, although implementation of adaptation plans continues to lag.

Setting realistic policy goals requires knowing the amount of different NBS types that can fit in the urban space and the benefits that can be expected. This research aims to assess the potential for a full-scale implementation of NBS for climate-change adaptation in European cities, the expected benefits and co-benefits, and how these quantities relate to the urban structure of the cities. We selected three case studies: Barcelona (Spain), Malmo (Sweden), and Utrecht (the Netherlands), and developed six scenarios that simulate the current condition, the full-scale implementation of different NBS strategies (i.e., installing green roofs, de-sealing parking areas, enhancing vegetation in urban parks, and planting street trees), and a combination of them. Then we applied spatially-explicit methods to assess, for each scenario, two climate change-related benefits, i.e. heat mitigation and stormwater regulation, and three co benefits, namely carbon storage, biodiversity potential, and overall greenness. Finally, by breaking down the results per land use class, we investigated how the potential and benefits vary depending on the urban form. Most scenarios provide multiple benefits, but each one is characterized by a specific mix. In all cities, a full-scale deployment of green roofs shows the greatest potential to reduce runoff and increase biodiversity, while tree planting-either along streets or in urban parks- produces the greatest impact on heat mitigation and greenness. However, these results entail interventions of different size and in different locations. Planting street trees maximizes interventions in residential areas, but key opportunities for integrating most NBS types also lie in commercial and industrial areas. The results on the pros and cons of each scenario can support policy-makers in designing targeted NBS strategies for climate change adaptation.","[Cortinovis, Chiara; Olsson, Peter; Boke-Olen, Niklas; Hedlund, Katarina] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Sci, Solvegatan 37, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Cortinovis, Chiara] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Rudower Chaussee 16, D-12489 Berlin, Germany",Lund University; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Cortinovis, C (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Sci, Solvegatan 37, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",chiara.cortinovis@cec.lu.se,"Cortinovis, Chiara/AAN-7260-2020","Cortinovis, Chiara/0000-0002-9612-4731; Boke-Olen, Niklas/0000-0003-2441-7153",Horizon 2020 project NATURVATION [730243]; FORMAS project Nature-based solutions for urban challenges [2016-00324]; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation,Horizon 2020 project NATURVATION; FORMAS project Nature-based solutions for urban challenges; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation),"This research received funding from the Horizon 2020 project NATURVATION (grant agreement 730243) and from the FORMAS project Nature-based solutions for urban challenges (n. 2016-00324) .

To mitigate the negative impacts of climate change and variability, farming households have been encouraged to adopt different strategies such as new crop varieties, crop and livestock diversification, and water-harvesting technologies. These adaptation strategies are expected to boost both the amount of food produced and food security of an adapting household; which in this case is defined one that has taken up one or more of the twenty-five climate change and climate variability adaptation techniques identified during the study. Using maize yield equivalent (MYE), which expresses farm production in equivalent kgs of maize grain, as a measure of total crop production and food security, this study assessed the factors influencing adaptation to climate change and climate variability, and the implications of adaptation for food security. To accomplish these objectives, an endogenous switching regression model was applied to household survey data of 658 households from 38 counties in Kenya. The results demonstrated that increases in mean air temperature and precipitation influenced levels of food production either negatively or positively depending on whether they occur at harvest, land preparation or during crop growing periods. The type of soil also influenced productivity as households living in areas with different soil types produce varying quantities of MYE in kgs/ha of land. Household characteristics and ownership of farm assets also influenced adaptation. By comparing production of adapting and non-adapting households, we demonstrated that households adapting to climate change and climate variability through uptake of technologies such as early planting, use of improved crop varieties, and crop diversification produced 4877 kgs of MYE/ha per year against 3238 kgs of MYE/ha per year for households that did not adapt (a 33.6% difference between the two groups). Given the nature of for smallscale households who produce mainly for household consumption, high crop yields translate to increased food security. We can therefore conclude that successful adaptation to climate change and climate variability significantly increases food security in Kenya.","[Kabubo-Mariara, Jane] Univ Nairobi, PEP, Nairobi, Kenya; [Kabubo-Mariara, Jane; Mulwa, Richard] Univ Nairobi, Sch Econ, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mulwa, Richard] Univ Nairobi, CASELAP, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Nairobi; University of Nairobi; University of Nairobi,"Mulwa, R (corresponding author), Univ Nairobi, Sch Econ, Nairobi, Kenya.;Mulwa, R (corresponding author), Univ Nairobi, CASELAP, Nairobi, Kenya.",jmariara@uonbi.ac.ke; richard.mulwa@uonbi.ac.ke,,,,,,,58,12,12,5,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1876-4517,1876-4525,,FOOD SECUR,Food Secur.,DEC,2019,11,6,,,,,1289,1304,,10.1007/s12571-019-00965-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-019-00965-4,,,16,Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Food Science & Technology,JT6BB,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000501071800009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The second stage, done against the background of a general review of spatial planning tools, involved identifying the tools that could be assigned to the already identified thematic areas of urban adaptation to climate change. The number of tools used was totalled at the third and final stage, and synthetic analysis of the tools used was performed using a set of selected criteria.

Assessing the actual adaptation potential in the agricultural sector is therefore an empirical issue, to which this paper contributes by presenting a study examining the impacts of climate change on cereal yields in 55 developing and developed countries, using data from 1991 to 2015. The results indicate that cereal yields are affected in all regions by changes in temperature and precipitation, with significant differences in certain macro-regions in the world. In Southern Asia and Central Africa, farmers fail to adapt to climate change.

Using the case of food insecure households in the district of Humla in northwestern Nepal, the study demonstrates that the same social and power relations that are driving local vulnerability dynamics, such as caste, gender, and access to social and political networks, also play important roles in shaping the impact of CCA policies. By tracing Nepal's CCA programs, starting with the local level, through district to international-national level dynamics, the study adds insights into the barriers to exclusion that embed power relations all the way through the chain of policy development. The purpose is to better understand how CCA can perpetuate rather than alleviate the conditions that create differential vulnerability patterns at village level. It raises questions about how whether CCA programs are an adequate response to increasing vulnerability for some of the world's most marginalized people. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The EACC study addresses many of the shortcomings found in the adaptation cost literature. First, it defines 'adaptation costs' as those additional costs of development due to climate change, thereby avoiding confounding the costs of closing the development deficit and the implicit adaptation deficit. Second, the study covers eight major sectors: infrastructure, coastal zones, water supply, agriculture, fisheries, forests and ecosystems, human health, and extreme weather events. Third, it employs common population and GDP growth trajectories across sectors and uses two climate scenarios to capture the full spread of model predictions. Finally, the EACC study uses an innovative methodology for aggregating costs at the sector level within a country, and across countries. Under these assumptions, the global price tag for the developing world of adapting to an approximately 2 degrees C warmer world by 2050 is US$70-100 billion per year for 2010-2050.","[Narain, Urvashi; Margulis, Sergio] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Essam, Timothy] Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",The World Bank; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Narain, U (corresponding author), World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",unarain@worldbank.org,,,,,,,39,43,44,2,62,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

There is a simultaneous need for both the clear articulation of the vulnerabilities of specific management systems to climate risk, and the development of appropriate short- and long-term strategic planning responses that anticipate environmental change or allow for sustainable adaptive management in response to trends in resource condition. Governments are developing climate change adaptation policy frameworks, but without the recognition of the importance of responding strategically, regional stakeholders will struggle to manage future climate risk. In a partnership between the South Australian Government, the Adelaide and Mt Lofty Ranges Natural Resource Management Board and the regional community, a range of available research approaches to support regional climate change adaptation decision-making, were applied and critically examined, including: scenario modelling; applied and participatory Geographical Information Systems modelling; environmental risk analysis; and participatory action learning. As managers apply ideas for adaptation within their own biophysical and socio-cultural contexts, there would be both successes and failures, but a learning orientation to societal change will enable improvements over time. A base-line target for regional responses to climate change is the ownership of the issue by stakeholders, which leads to an acceptance that effective actions to adapt are now both possible and vitally important. Beyond such baseline knowledge, the research suggests that there is a range of tools from the social and physical sciences available to guide adaptation decision-making.","[Bardsley, Douglas K.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Social Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Sweeney, Susan M.] Govt S Australia, Dept Water Land & Biodivers Conservat, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Bardsley, DK (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Social Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",douglas.bardsley@adelaide.edu.au,,,"SA Department of Water, Land and Biodiversity Conservation; Australian Government through the Australian Greenhouse Office in the Department of the Environment and Water Resources; AMLR NRM Board","SA Department of Water, Land and Biodiversity Conservation; Australian Government through the Australian Greenhouse Office in the Department of the Environment and Water Resources(Australian Government); AMLR NRM Board","The authors wish to thank the many people within the AMLR and the natural resource management community more generally, who assisted them during the development of the climate change project.

Climate change adaptation involves strategics of adjusting to the negative effects of climate change, while climate change mitigation involves techniques that help to reduce production of greenhouse gases through burning fossil fuels. The African worldview from the frontier of Nigerian epistemological and ontological perspectives as it finds expression in climate change adaptation and mitigation is built on the foundations of its relationship with nature, traditional religion and belief systems, agricultural practices, and some other day-to-day practices. Worldview analysis of the contemporary Nigerian has been conducted and classified into Original African. Westernized African. and Little Here-and-There African. a paradigm existing in Nigerians irrespective of level of Western education. What will be the fate of the younger Nigerian climate scientist in a globalized and technologically competitive world?

This paper discusses existing international funding to support adaptation needs (primarily through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and official development assistance (ODA)), the serious shortfall in these funds, and opportunities for meeting the gap in funding.

Perceptions regarding long-term changes in climate variables and the rate of occurrence of weather extremes were also investigated. Additionally, farmers' perceived barriers to the use of adaptation practices were identified and ranked. A total of 100 farm-households were randomly selected from four communities in the Lawra district of Ghana and data were collected through semi-structured questionnaires, focused group discussions and field observations. A logistic regression model and weighted average index were used to analyze the data. The results showed that 87 % of respondents perceived a decrease in rainfall amount, while 82 % perceived an increase in temperature over the past 10 years. Results of the weighted average index indicate that dry spell and drought have a higher annual rate of occurrence than flood. Empirical results of the logistic regression model showed that education, household size, annual household income, access to information, credit and membership of farmer-based organization are the most important factors that influence farmers' adaptation to climate change. The main constraints on adaptation include unpredictability of weather, high farm input cost, lack of access to timely weather information and water resources. The policy implication of this study is that governments should mainstream barriers to, and choice factors of, adaptation practices to climate change related projects and programs.","[Ndamani, Francis] Kochi Univ Technol, Grad Sch Engn, 185-1 Miyanokuchi, Kami City, Kochi 7820003, Japan; [Watanabe, Tsunemi] Kochi Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, 185-1 Miyanokuchi, Kami City, Kochi 7820003, Japan",Kochi University Technology; Kochi University Technology,"Ndamani, F (corresponding author), Kochi Univ Technol, Grad Sch Engn, 185-1 Miyanokuchi, Kami City, Kochi 7820003, Japan.",176010t@gs.kochi-tech.ac.jp,,,,,,,31,81,84,1,35,UNIV SAO PAOLO,CERQUERA CESAR,"AV  DR ENEAS DE CARVALHO AGUIAR, 419, CERQUERA CESAR, SP 05403-000, BRAZIL",1678-992X,,,SCI AGR,Sci.

We built a theoretical framework based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and performed both binary and count estimations to explore the determinants affecting farmers' adoption of LCTs. Our results indicated that most rice farmers strongly agreed they observed shifting local weather conditions (52.74% of respondents) and irregular rainfall patterns (52.56%) within the last year. Further, over twothirds of the respondents perceived that agricultural production contributes to climate variability (26.73% strongly agreed, and 40.54% agreed with that statement). In terms of the adoption intensity of LCTs, we found that about 96% of rice farmers implemented at least one low-carbon technology. Importantly, farmers' perceptions of climate change were positively associated with climate change adaptation. Other significant predictors of climate change adaptation included gender, years of experience, access to agricultural training through extension services, exchange of technical information among farmers, and access to mobile networks and postal services. We underlined policy recommendations that may accelerate climate change adaptation in rice production and complement current agricultural low-carbon programs in China. C() 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding farmers' perceptions of climate change and the types of adjustments they have made in their farming practices in response to these changes will offer some insights into necessary interventions to ensure a successful adaptation in the region. This paper explores how smallholder farmers in the Nigerian savanna perceive and adapt to climate change. It is based on a field survey carried out among 200 smallholder farm households selected from two agro-ecological zones. The results show that most of the farmers have noticed changes in climate and have consequently adjusted their farming practices to adapt. There are no large differences in the adaptation practices across the region, but farmers in Sudan savanna agro-ecological zone are more likely to adapt to changes in temperature than those in northern Guinea savanna. The main adaptation methods include varying planting dates, use of drought tolerant and early maturing varieties and tree planting. Some of the farmers are facing limitations in adapting because of lack of information on climate change and the suitable adaptation measures and lack of credit. The study then concludes that to ensure successful adaptation to climate change in the region, concerted efforts are needed to design and promote planned adaptation measures that fit into the local context and also to educate farmers on climate change and appropriate adaptation measures.","[Tambo, Justice Akpene] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Bonn, Germany; [Abdoulaye, Tahirou] Int Inst Trop Agr, Ibadan, Nigeria",University of Bonn; CGIAR; International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA),"Tambo, JA (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Bonn, Germany.",jatambo@uni-bonn.de,,,International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) through the DTMA project,International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) through the DTMA project,"The authors are very grateful to participants at the Emerging Scholars Symposium, COP 17 in Durban, for their helpful comments and discussion and the three anonymous reviewers who helped to improve the paper.

The Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) is a scheme where industrialized countries have (as of early 2016) disbursed $934.5 million in voluntary contributions, raised more than four times that amount in co-financing, and supported 213 adaptation projects across 51 least developed countries. But what sorts of challenges have arisen during implementation? Based on extensive field research in five least developed countries-Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, the Maldives, and Vanuatu-and original data collected from almost 150 research interviews, this article qualitatively explores both the benefits and challenges of LDCF projects in the Asia-Pacific. It finds that while LDCF projects do contribute to enhancing multiple types of infrastructural, institutional, and community-based adaptive capacity, they also suffer from uncertainty, a convoluted management structure, and an inability to fully respond to climate risks. Based on these findings, the study concludes that adaptation must be pursued as a multidimensional process; and that LDCF activities have tended to promote marginal rather than more radical or systematic transformations.","[Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business & Technol, Birk Ctr Pk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Sch Business, Sci Policy Res Unit, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Linner, Bjorn-Ola] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Linner, Bjorn-Ola] Univ Oxford, Inst Sci Innovat & Soc, Oxford, England; [Klein, Richard J.

Based on their most current adaptation planning documentation individual states are grouped into four categories depending on how far they are in their approach towards adaptation to predicted changes in climate and how they have progressed with their planning efforts in defining adaptation measures. The analysis of the state adaptation plans showed that 13 states had detailed sector specific actions recommended, 2 states had sector specific targets and recommendation, 14 states had expressed concern and need for adaptation planning, whereas 21 states did not mention the need for adaptation planning. The statistical analysis showed that Democratic Party popular votes are 10 % higher in states with detailed sector specific actions recommended in comparison to states with no mention of adaptation planning (p < 0.01). The average gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in states having an adaptation planning status with detailed sector specific actions recommended is more than $6,000 higher compared to states with expressed concern and need for adaptation planning and states with no mention of adaptation planning (p < 0.05). The average coastal population in states with detailed sector specific actions recommended is more than seven times higher compared to states with expressed concern and states with no mention of adaptation planning (p < 0.01). It is concluded that the U.S. state planning initiatives will need to strengthen their approach to adaptation planning substantially to have holistic and more coordinated adaptation planning efforts.","[Lysak, Marin; Bugge-Henriksen, Christian] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Hojbakkegard Alle 30, DK-2630 Taastrup, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Lysak, M (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Hojbakkegard Alle 30, DK-2630 Taastrup, Denmark.",marinrr@plen.ku.dk; cbh@plen.ku.dk,"Henriksen, Christian Bugge/J-8685-2014","Henriksen, Christian Bugge/0000-0003-2890-4522",,,,,44,9,10,5,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Not surprisingly, little research makes use of a planning lens to explore the challenge of utilizing policy measures to address social vulnerability - particularly in relation to climate change. Through a scholarly narrative review of interdisciplinary sources an indepth understanding of climate change vulnerability is gained and its importance in successful adaptation planning demonstrated. The urgency and complexity of climate change requires overcoming socio-political barriers within the existing adaptation paradigm, balancing technocratic methods with a collaborative approach focusing on the social, economic and ethical components of vulnerability to climate change.","[Kehler, Sarah; Birchall, S.

The case study provided useful insights into why there is little evidence of effective climate change adaptation being implemented despite significant advances in climate impacts and adaptation science over the last decade. It was found that in order to bridge the gap between climate change adaptation recommendations and successful implementation at practitioner level there is a demand for: improved translation, communication and packaging of existing climate science information into sector-and location-specific impacts (e.g. hydrological interpretation of climate model rainfall projections and the associated uncertainties); attribution of historical and future hydroclimatic changes (e.g. not just what has happened or is going to happen but why and the confidence and likelihoods surrounding that); quantification of costs and benefits of any decision; and understanding of the social, political, and environmental contexts and level of acceptance associated with any decision.","[Kiem, Anthony S.; Austin, Emma K.; Verdon-Kidd, Danielle C.] Univ Newcastle, Fac Sci & Informat Technol, Ctr Water Climate & Land Use CWCL, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Kiem, AS (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Fac Sci & Informat Technol, Ctr Water Climate & Land Use CWCL, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",anthony.kiem@newcastle.edu.au,"VERDON-KIDD, DANIELLE CHERIE/G-7688-2013; Kiem, Anthony/D-9307-2013","VERDON-KIDD, DANIELLE CHERIE/0000-0001-5334-4251; Kiem, Anthony/0000-0002-3994-6958",Australian Government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency); National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF),Australian Government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency)(Australian Government); National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF),This work was carried out with financial support from the Australian Government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) and the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF).

Although the relevance of implementing adaptation strategies is widely recognized, studies on firms' adaptation to climate change are still in their infancy, especially regarding small and medium enterprises. Following a multi-stage approach, we analyze how small and medium enterprises in the marine food industry could adapt to climate-induced ocean acidification through product innovation. First, we use a co-production process with the firms' representatives to gain insights into the industry's adaptation opportunities, in which product innovation arises as the preferred strategy. Second, using a Discrete Choice Experiment, we test if consumers value both the mussels' attributes likely affected by ocean acidification (sensory and nutritional) and the proposed new products developed to adapt to it. We also analyze preferences' heterogeneity through a latent class model. Our results show that consumers value the attributes potentially affected by ocean acidification. We found high heterogeneity in consumer preferences regarding product types, disentangled into two classes (non-innovative consumers and consumers willing to innovate). We suggest that the industry could base its adaptation strategy on two pillars: 1) maintain the traditional format, thus satisfying 21% of the market (non-innovative consumers); 2) direct the innovation efforts towards the canned format, thus satisfying those consumers willing to innovate (79% of the market). Although consumers willing to innovate are prone to try new formats, the preferred alternatives are not radical innovations.","[Ponce Oliva, Roberto D.; Huaman, Joana; Vasquez-Lavin, Felipe] Univ Desarrollo, Sch Business & Econ, Concepcion, Chile; [Ponce Oliva, Roberto D.; Vasquez-Lavin, Felipe; Gelcich, Stefan] Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, Santiago, Chile; [Ponce Oliva, Roberto D.; Vasquez-Lavin, Felipe; Gelcich, Stefan] Inst Milenio Socioecol Costera SECOS, Santiago, Chile; [Barrientos, Manuel] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Durham, England; [Gelcich, Stefan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Santiago, Chile",Universidad del Desarrollo; Durham University; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Oliva, RDP (corresponding author), Ainavillo 456, Concepcion, Chile.",robertoponce@udd.cl,,"Vasquez Lavin, Felipe/0000-0002-0767-998X; Huaman, Joana/0000-0002-1625-9151; Ponce, Roberto D./0000-0001-5024-7456",ANID PIA/BASAL [FB0002]; Millennium initiative [ICN 2019_015]; National Agency for Research and Development (ANID)/Scholarship Program/DOCTORADO BECAS CHILE/2021 [21211680],ANID PIA/BASAL; Millennium initiative; National Agency for Research and Development (ANID)/Scholarship Program/DOCTORADO BECAS CHILE/2021,"This study was funded by the ANID PIA/BASAL FB0002, the Millennium initiative ICN 2019_015, and the National Agency for Research and Development (ANID)/Scholarship Program/DOCTORADO BECAS CHILE/2021 -21211680.",,128,1,1,5,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

Accordingly, the study population was farmers at Aq Qala County in the north of Iran (N= 5,447). The sample size was estimated using the Bartlett Table (n= 119), and participants were selected through a simple random sampling method. The list of appropriate CSA technologies was prepared using a relevant article and adjusted to the local condition by the agricultural experts' comments in the research area. Results indicated that farmers' agreement is mainly higher than their willingness to pay for CSA technology. Specifically, they prefer to pay for technologies with low cost and short-term benefits (e g , minimum tillage, cover crops method, concentrate feeding for livestock, and crop insurance). Results of this study have practical implications for agricultural agencies in climate change adaptation planning at local level in that farmers should be trained to use low cost practices when they apply CSA practices.

Around 3.26 million rural Bangladeshi households are landless. These landless households usually constitute the poorest and most vulnerable groups in Bangladesh and are the first victims of climatic hazards. Despite the adaptation measures taken by the government and non-governmental organizations, landlessness generates constraints to adapt to the changing environment. Taking the above premises, this paper principally aims to unveil how landlessness poses challenges for the rural poor of Bangladesh in their endeavor to adapt to already emerging conditions of climate change. Based on qualitative interviews of relevant stakeholders, this paper finds that landlessness is a key challenge to the climate change adaptation process as it hinders livelihoods and income-generating activities of the people living in rural and coastal regions.

Snowmelt introduces varying runoff patterns throughout the year depending on the size and saturation of the snowpack. Similarly, burn-scarred landscapes following wildfires can significantly enhance flood flows, sediment, and debris in streams and rivers. Extreme flood and debris flows produced from these conditions significantly affect downstream transportation infrastructure, causing damage to bridges, culverts, and roadways. A baseline stormwater management model (SWMM) was composed to understand the watershed hydrology assuming only rainfall precipitation and natural, healed land cover. Subsequent modeling of the independent variables determined the degree of hydrologic change based on project climate stressors and to what degree the infrastructure is affected. The final goal was to identify the most cost-effective adaptation solution that meets all agency and community standards and needs. The Little Indian Creek Culvert Assessment provides a useful pilot, and draft tools and process, to inform similar projects at departments of transportation.","[Navaroli, Kristen] WSP USA Inc, Raleigh, NC 27601 USA; [Dorney, Chris] WSP USA Inc, Herndon, VA USA; [Lennon, Justin] WSP USA Inc, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Flood, Michael] WSP USA Inc, Baltimore, MD USA; [Miller, Rawlings] WSP USA Inc, Boston, MA USA; [Shrestha, Eleeja] WSP USA Inc, Las Vegas, NV USA; [Grose, Timothy] WSP USA Inc, San Francisco, CA USA; [Ragsdale, Annika] WSP USA Inc, Sacramento, CA USA",,"Navaroli, K (corresponding author), WSP USA Inc, Raleigh, NC 27601 USA.",Kristen.navaroli@wsp.com,,"Navaroli, Kristen/0000-0002-4972-8911",,,,,11,0,0,2,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0361-1981,2169-4052,,TRANSPORT RES REC,Transp.

However, the extent of climate adaptation planning and management activities by such agencies at the national level is unknown. This study aimed to fill this gap by conducting a national survey of the directors of PRDs (n = 413) to understand the progress and drivers of climate change adaptation efforts for urban green spaces. Overall, we found that while measured impacts of climate change were positively correlated with PRDs' climate-change adaptation plans and actions, most PRDs perceived few impacts of climate change on urban green spaces. We also found that levels of adaptation varied across ecoregions, with direct experiences with climate change impacts being a primary contributor to action. These findings indicate that U.S. municipal PRDs are unprepared for the changing climate and are unlikely to initiate urban green space adaptation planning and action until substantial climate change impacts are experienced firsthand.","[Cheng, Yuan (Daniel)] Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, 301 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Farmer, James R.; Fischer, Burnell C.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Dickinson, Stephanie L.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Robeson, Scott M.] Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Reynolds, Heather L.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Cheng, Y (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, 301 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",cheng838@umn.edu,,"Dickinson, Stephanie/0000-0002-2998-4467; Robeson, Scott/0000-0002-1558-6951; Cheng, Yuan (Daniel)/0000-0003-3937-1792",,,,,57,7,7,11,38,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0955,,,URBAN CLIM,Urban CLim.,SEP,2021,39,,,,,,,,100962,10.1016/j.uclim.2021.100962,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2021.100962,,AUG 2021,17,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WB4TU,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000703566800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we performed a numerical prediction on how much climate change adaptation factors related to forest policy can reduce climate disasters such as landslides. We focused on the landslide in Korea and applied a machine learning model reflecting adaptive indicators in the representative concentration pathway 8.5 climate scenario. The changes in the landslide probability were estimated using the Random Forest model, which estimated the landslide probability in the baseline period (2011) with excellent performance, and the spatial adaptation indicators used in this study contributed approximately 20%. The future landslide risk predicting indicated a significant increase in the Very High and High risk areas, especially in 2092. The application of the forest-related adaptation indices based on the policy scenario showed that in 2050, the effect was not pronounced, but in 2092, when the risk of landslides was much higher, the effect increased significantly. In particular, the effect was remarkable in the Seoul metropolitan and southern coastal regions. Even with the same adaptive capacity, it exerted a larger effect on the enhanced disasters. Our results suggest that the enhancement of adaptive capacity can reduce landslide risk up to 70% in a Very High risk region. In conclusion, it implies an importance to respond to the intensifying climate disasters, and abundant follow-up studies are expected to appear in the future.","[Lim, Chul-Hee] Kookmin Univ, Coll Gen Educ, 77 Jeongneungro, Seoul 02707, South Korea; [Lim, Chul-Hee] Kookmin Univ, Inst Forest Sci, 77 Jeongneungro, Seoul 02707, South Korea; [Kim, Hyun-Jun] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Forest Resources, 77 Yongbong Ro, Gwangju 61186, South Korea",Kookmin University; Kookmin University; Chonnam National University,"Kim, HJ (corresponding author), Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Forest Resources, 77 Yongbong Ro, Gwangju 61186, South Korea.",clim@kookmin.ac.kr; hjkim0837@jnu.ac.kr,,"Lim, Chul-Hee/0000-0001-7752-0694; Kim, Hyun-Jun/0000-0002-7373-1643",Korea Forest Service [2020183C10-2022-AA02]; National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Science and ICT [2021R1F1A1063809]; Kookmin University grant,"Korea Forest Service(Korea Forest Service); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Ministry of Science and ICT(Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); Kookmin University grant","This research was funded by the Korea Forest Service (No. 2020183C10-2022-AA02), National Research Foundation of Korea grant provided by the Ministry of Science and ICT (No. 2021R1F1A1063809) and Kookmin University grant.",,53,2,2,3,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,JAN,2022,13,1,,,,,,,49,10.3390/f13010049,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13010049,,,18,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,YN8BC,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000747476700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this approach, changes in regional agricultural production, which are based on comparative advantage, define patterns of land use change in agriculture in all regions of the world. We evaluate four scenarios that combine assumptions about future increases in food demand and future changes in land endowments of different productivities associated with climatic conditions: each scenario generates distinct patterns of regional specialization in the production of agricultural commodities and associated land-use change. The analysis also projects future food availability under the simulated conditions and the direction of likely changes in prices of the major agricultural commodity groups.","[Julia, Roxana] NYU, Coll Arts & Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Duchin, Faye] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Econ, Troy, NY 12180 USA",New York University; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"Julia, R (corresponding author), NYU, Coll Arts & Sci, 726 Broadway,6th Floor, New York, NY 10003 USA.",rj34@nyu.edu; duchin@rpi.edu,,,"Summer Research Grant Program at the Global Liberal Studies Program, College of Arts and Science, New York University; National Science Foundation under Combined Natural and Human System (CNH) [1115025]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1115025] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Summer Research Grant Program at the Global Liberal Studies Program, College of Arts and Science, New York University; National Science Foundation under Combined Natural and Human System (CNH); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","This research was conducted with partial support awarded to Roxana Julia by the Summer Research Grant Program at the Global Liberal Studies Program, College of Arts and Science, New York University, Summer of 2011.

It is acknowledged that alteration of wind, solar, and water resources by climate change might degrade power generation of WSHCSs; however, comprehensive evaluation of the potential impact of climate change on the energy production, reliability, and power curtailment of WSHCSs remains lacking. Furthermore, quantification of the contribution of complementary operation of a WSHCS in adapting to climate change impacts represents another vital knowledge gap. To address these problems, this study constructed a top-down model chain by integrating global climate models, hydrological models, and energy system operation models. The large-scale WSHCS in the Yalong River Basin (China) was considered as a case study. Results indicated substantial complementarity among the variation of monthly streamflow, wind speed, and solar radiation under a changing climate. The total energy production and reliability of the WSHCS could be guaranteed under most future climate scenarios, while power curtailment risk would increase. Although climate change impacts dominate change in system operation performance, complementary operation can contribute a positive effect to a certain extent, especially for higher reliability and lower power curtailment. The findings indicate the effectiveness of the complementary operation in adapting to climate change impacts on the Yalong River WSHCS. The major novelty of this study is quantification of the contribution of complementary operation in adapting to climate change impacts on WSHCSs, which provides valuable insight regarding evaluation of complementary systems.","[Cheng, Qian; Liu, Pan; Xia, Jun; Cheng, Lei; Chen, Jie; Xie, Kang; Liu, Zheyuan; Li, Xiao] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn Sc, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Qian; Liu, Pan; Cheng, Lei; Chen, Jie; Xie, Kang; Liu, Zheyuan; Li, Xiao] Wuhan Univ, Hubei Prov Key Lab Water Syst Sci Sponge City Cons, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Qian; Liu, Pan; Cheng, Lei; Chen, Jie; Xie, Kang; Liu, Zheyuan; Li, Xiao] Wuhan Univ, Res Inst Water Secur RIWS, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Xia, Jun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Ming, Bo] Xian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Ecohydraul Northwest Arid Reg, Xian 710048, Peoples R China","Wuhan University; Wuhan University; Wuhan University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Xi'an University of Technology","Liu, P (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn Sc, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",liupan@whu.edu.cn,"liu, zheyuan/GZL-9719-2022","Cheng, Lei/0000-0002-5298-9573; Xie, Kang/0000-0002-3805-8174",Joint Funds of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1865201]; National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars [52225901]; Innovation Team in Key Field of the Ministry of Science and Technology [2018RA4014],Joint Funds of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); Innovation Team in Key Field of the Ministry of Science and Technology,"This study was supported by the Joint Funds of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. U1865201) , the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (Grant No. 52225901) , and the Innovation Team in Key Field of the Ministry of Science and Technology (Grant No. 2018RA4014) .",,51,2,2,51,60,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-2619,1872-9118,,APPL ENERG,Appl.

The community is not currently overwhelmed by climate change impacts, and has local agents and institutions in place to facilitate anticipatory climate adaptation planning. However, as seen with many other coastal communities, implementation of adaptation action is lagging in practice. Framed through the lens of resilience theory, this research investigates climate change threats and the dynamic relationship between local scale adaptation policy development, integration and implementation in practice. With Surrey as a case study, this research examines key actor narratives and strategic planning documents in order to understand how the community acts on climate change adaptation while being mandated to address mitigation. Findings suggests that while resilience building agents (e.g. senior management, elected officials) can spearhead and organize climate action, their ability to implement goals and policies in practice is largely determined by the robustness of institutions (e.g. strategic plans, policies) and systems (e.g. infrastructure, ecosystems). This case may provide decision-makers in other communities coping with similar climate threats with insight into the factors that can enable and challenge local adaptation planning processes.","[Birchall, S.

Many cities have investigated the possibility of implementing stormwater management (SWM) systems which are multi-functional and consist of different elements interacting to achieve desired safety levels. Typically, an economic assessment is carried out in the planning phase, while environmental sustainability is given little or no attention. In this paper, life cycle assessment is used to quantify environmental impacts of climate change adaptation strategies. The approach is tested using a climate change adaptation strategy for a catchment in Copenhagen, Denmark. A stormwater management system, using green infrastructure and local retention measures in combination with planned routing of stormwater on the surfaces to manage runoff, is compared to a traditional, sub-surface approach. Flood safety levels based on the Three Points Approach are defined as the functional unit to ensure comparability between systems. The adaptation plan has significantly lower impacts (3-18 person equivalents/year) than the traditional alternative (14-103 person equivalents/year) in all analysed impact categories. The main impacts are caused by managing rain events with return periods between 0.2 and 10 years. The impacts of handling smaller events with a return period of up to 0.2 years and extreme events with a return period of up to 100 years are lower in both alternatives. The uncertainty analysis shows the advantages of conducting an environmental assessment in the early stages of the planning process, when the design can still be optimised, but it also highlights the importance of detailed and site-specific data.

Despite the dissemination of scientific forecasts (SF) from national meteorological systems, arable farmers in rural areas are still very vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability and change. Using mixed methods approach, the study adopted random and stratified sampling in the selection of 580 arable farmers to investigate the problem under this study. Data were collected using a household survey and focus group discussions, and the multivariate probit model was used in the analysis. The findings indicated that use of IF only positively influenced crop diversification, soil and water conservation. Using both SF and IF positively influenced livestock diversification. Use of either IF only or both SF and IF positively influenced tree-planting and tree crop production as an adaptive strategy. The study recommends that although forecasts are important drivers of adaptation, other factors could also help efforts to enhance climate-change adaptation, such as improving land rights through more recognition of formal customary rights and land tenure and capacity building of farmer-to-farmer networks with climate-change information. Increasing the spread of weather stations in the different agro-ecological zones by national governments and development partners would improve the predictive accuracy and local specificity of scientific forecasts, resulting in improved climate-change adaptation.","[Nkuba, Michael Robert; Chanda, Raban; Mmopelwa, Gagoitseope; Lesolle, David] Univ Botswana, Dept Environm Sci, 4775 Notwane Rd,Private Bag 00704, Gaborone, Botswana; [Kato, Edward] Int Food Policy & Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Mangheni, Margaret N.] Makerere Univ, Dept Extens & Innovat Studies, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, POB 7062, Kampala, Uganda",University of Botswana; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Makerere University,"Nkuba, MR (corresponding author), Univ Botswana, Dept Environm Sci, 4775 Notwane Rd,Private Bag 00704, Gaborone, Botswana.",mnkuba@gmail.com,"Nkuba, Michael/GWZ-8252-2022; CHANDA, RABAN/AAA-2189-2021","Nkuba, Michael/0000-0002-6434-9100; ",,,,,92,10,11,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0364-152X,1432-1009,,ENVIRON MANAGE,Environ.

This review assesses what the literature tells us about its role in facilitating adaptation in lower income countries. It also explores how far thinking on an integrated adaptive social protection (ASP) agenda considers transforming the socioeconomic and political contexts where vulnerability to climate change originates. The review finds that research to date focuses on how instruments such as cash or asset transfers can protect the poor from shocks and stresses, prevent households from falling into poverty as a result of climate change, and promote climate-resilient livelihoods. However, it cautions that such interventions must go beyond helping households to cope against shocks over short time horizons; they should enable the adoption of forward-looking strategies for long-lasting adaptation. Much less attention in the literature is given to whether social protection measures might have transformational effects for recipients. This is despite the fact that the earliest proponents of ASP favored a rights-based approach to social protection to address issues of inequality and marginalization which are at the root of poverty and vulnerability to climate change. Although the role of social protection should not be overstated, it holds promise as a tool for building adaptive capacity. However, the potential of ASP to be truly transformational for its recipients by tackling the structural causes of vulnerability to climate change is not yet harnessed by policymakers. This constitutes a missed opportunity for the agenda to deliver on the international community's promise to leave no one behind.

Yet in the current context of climate change, in which we turn to genetics, irrigation or innovation in cultural practices to maintain production quality, could the mountain environment emerge as a solution for adapting to climate change in vine-growing? Here we explore the role of cooperative policies that may be deployed on the territorial scale, using an agent-based model. Our model was based on the viticulture of the Banyuls-Collioures AOC area, which is characterized by small-scale vine-growers and marked by widespread involvement in cooperative systems. The simulation results showed an important role of cooperative policies not only to conserve narrow production window and required vine quality, but also in respect of the emblematic landscape structure. These results should foster vine-growers to strengthen their cooperatives and adequately use these organizations to mitigate future climate change impacts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As a matter of necessity, farmers must respond to changing the climate by choosing adaptation strategies that increase their productivities. Incidentally, studies that documented the impact of climate change adaptation actions of farmers on rice productivity are few. This study therefore analyzed the impact of climate change adaptation decisions of farmers on the profitability of rice production using cross-sectional data gathered from 240 rice farmers selected from Ebonyi State, an important rice-producing State in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country. Using descriptive statistics, multivariate probit regression, instrumental variable regression and endogenous treatment effect model, the study revealed that the common adaptation actions of rice farmers involved adoption of minimum tillage, bond and drainage, fertilizer, crop diversification, livelihood diversification, improved rice varieties, pesticide, nursery, and adjusting planting and harvesting dates. The study found several significant interactions between the choice of climate change adaptation actions and socio-economic, farm, institutional and location characteristics of rice farmers. The result further revealed that multiple adaptation decisions of farmers significantly increased returns to scale and profit of rice production. The study concludes that adaptation decisions are effective in increasing the profitability and returns to scale of rice production in the area and other regions with similar geographical, meteorological and socio-economic contexts.","[Onyeneke, Robert Ugochukwu] Alex Ekwueme Fed Univ, Agr Econ & Extens Programme, Dept Agr, Ndufu Alike, Ebonyi State, Nigeria",,"Onyeneke, RU (corresponding author), Alex Ekwueme Fed Univ, Agr Econ & Extens Programme, Dept Agr, Ndufu Alike, Ebonyi State, Nigeria.",robertonyeneke@yahoo.com,"Onyeneke, Robert/AAS-6211-2021","Onyeneke, Robert/0000-0002-9242-901X",,,,,116,9,11,1,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1742-1705,1742-1713,,RENEW AGR FOOD SYST,Renew.

The theoretical reflections are exemplified by transdisciplinary research experiences using the concept of SER as a bridging concept in the field of climate-change adaptation instead of developing a new and very context-specific conceptual bridge. The findings are based on ontological reflections concerning the complex and hybrid phenomenon of climate change and the need for transdisciplinary research as well as on reflections on the performed interdisciplinary research and the exploratory transdisciplinary research approach with practitioners from the German administration. The experiences so far have shown that it was more focused on the general ideas of social-ecological resilience thinking instead of using the concept of SER as an analytical tool. We conclude that the use of a common conceptual framework in general and of social-ecological resilience thinking in particular offers tangible advantages in transdisciplinary research dealing with climate change and adaptation to the impacts of climate change. In our case, social-ecological resilience thinking helped-after translation into practical terms-to open the field for further consideration from the very beginning as well as to open the space for common creative work; to define the problem; and to choose the relevant variables to look at.","[Deppisch, Sonja; Hasibovic, Sanin] HafenCity Univ Hamburg, D-22085 Hamburg, Germany",,"Deppisch, S (corresponding author), HafenCity Univ Hamburg, Winterhuder Weg 31, D-22085 Hamburg, Germany.",sonja.deppisch@hcu-hamburg.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Research and Education [FKZ 01UU0909],German Federal Ministry of Research and Education,"The authors would like to thank two anonymous reviewers and the editors of the special issue for their very helpful comments, the research group plan B:altic and Kaitlyn Rathwell for ongoing discussions.

To encourage adaptation in countries with a lot of privately owned forest, policy measures directed at private forest owners may be implemented. By means of policy scenarios, the present study examined the effects of two hypothetical policies: an advice and an economic incentive, on climate change adaptation among private forest owners in Sweden (n=753 and n=729). Both policies strengthened the intention to adapt although results also revealed that individual variables (i.e., forest values) and a contextual variable (i.e., being in an encouraging social risk management context) were important for the owners' response. Production forest values and social risk management context furthermore moderated the effect of policy on intention to adapt, suggesting that the economic incentive was mainly more effective than the advice among owners with strong production values and among owners in less encouraging social risk management contexts.","[Eriksson, Louise] Umea Univ, Dept Geog & Econ Hist, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Eriksson, L (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Geog & Econ Hist, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",louise.eriksson@umu.se,,"Eriksson, Louise/0000-0002-6673-0079",Swedish Research Council Formas [2012-370],Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),This research was part of the research project social perspectives on forest risks funded by The Swedish Research Council Formas (grant number: 2012-370).,,52,7,7,1,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0894-1920,1521-0723,,SOC NATUR RESOUR,Soc.

Analysis of documents and 26 in-depth interviews with key stakeholders sheds light on the ongoing climate change adaptation policy formulation process. Our study reveals that the CS of the Ministry of Environmental Protection functions as a bridge at different interfaces and can be characterized as a boundary worker between institutions. The inherent independence of this position facilitates the CS's ability to initiate, foster, and prioritize complex issues such as adaptation.

Climate change threatens to increase the potential for soil erosion, reduce soil quality, lower agricultural productivity and negatively impact food security and global sustainability, making it one of the most severe challenges we will face in the 21st century This paper looks at the potential of management to help us, not only mitigate climate change, but also to help us adapt to a changing climate. Different aspects of carbon management, nitrogen management, manure management, management in low-input systems (sustainable agriculture), and grazing land management are discussed as examples. Management decisions regarding conservation practices, such as no-till, conservation agriculture, and returning crop residue to the field to increase nutrient cycling, can contribute to carbon sequestration and help us mitigate and adapt to climate change. Additionally, management of grasslands, restoration of degraded/desertified lands, nitrogen management to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, precision conservation management at a field and/or watershed level, and other management alternatives can also help us mitigate and/or adapt to climate change. Management for climate change mitigation and adaptation is key for environmental conservation, sustainability of cropping systems, soil and water quality and food security This paper suggests, based on a review of the literature, that management decisions that reduce soil erosion, increase carbon sequestration to improve soil functions, soil quality, and soil health, and contribute to the resilience of soils and cropping systems will be needed to respond to climate change and related challenges such as food security. Our review suggests that without management decisions that increase soil and water conservation, food security for the world's growing population will be harder to achieve.","[Lal, R.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Delgado, J.

Within this context, weather is garnering greater attention for its dynamic, mediating role, yet its political and cultural significance remains under-researched. Here we draw on Serres and McCarren's (1992) idea of the Natural Contract and Vannini et al.'s (2012) contributions on weathering to integrate contractarianism with a deep account of people's relationship with weather in place. We analyse attitudes and adaptation to climate change in communities of the geographically-remote and climate-vulnerable Outer Hebrides in Scotland, using video-elicitation to generate data on significant places. Our results show that changing, difficult and unpredictable weather binds people to place and influences how they think about themselves, their place and adaptation in dynamic ways. Through this connection, we demonstrate that people knowingly enter into what we term Weather Contracts and that accepting the volatility of the weather allows people to react positively to changes brought with climate. Finally, we show that the common ideology of a community living with weather generates wider discourses around independence and resisting modernisation that we term a weathered ideology. Thus, climate change is not always a destabilising force. For those who are accustomed to changing weather it can be a dimension of place around which people can organise. Uncertainty and anxiety about the future of the climate is caused more by a lack of control over adaptation processes than by a fear of unknown weather. This has implications for people living at the margins across the globe, where unpredictable weather is a part of local identities, but influence on adaptation policy making is low.","[Butts, Deborah] 28 Woodstock Rd, London W4 1UF, England; [Adams, Helen] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, Bush House North East Wing,30 Aldwych, London WC2B 4BG, England",University of London; King's College London,"Butts, D (corresponding author), 28 Woodstock Rd, London W4 1UF, England.",debbievbutts@gmail.com; helen.j.adams@kcl.ac.uk,,"Adams, Helen/0000-0003-1732-9833",,,,,98,9,9,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

In federalist systems, sub-national governments are among key actors for enabling adaptation and their clear commitments can increase collaboration and innovation at the local level. Germany serves as a particularly insightful case for observing the variance among sub-national approaches due to its role as a leader in CCA at the national level. This paper provides the first systematic assessment of all sixteen state adaptation strategies in Germany and examines how German states are fostering adaptation, the extent to which their approaches vary, and which patterns have emerged. Based on a qualitative document analysis of over 30 documents, this assessment focuses on five indicators synthesized from literature climate policy analyses and on barriers and facilitating factors of adaptation. Results find that German state strategies are often non-committal sets of recommendations and identify three clusters displaying different degrees of institutionalization and guidance. While federalism allows for flexibility among state responses, the absence of federal mandates and policy standards allows some states to fall behind while others continue to develop their strategies to foster adaptation. These sixteen diverse approaches each have implications for adaptation governance at other levels.","[King, Julie P.] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-118, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"King, JP (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-118, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany.",Julie.king@uol.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [396892926],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

The extent of loss to lives and assets will also depend to a significant degree on whether or not climate change adaptation can be intensified and expanded to constituencies thus far not engaged in it. To date, tangible progress with climate change adaptation at the municipal scale is mostly limited to metropolises and large cities. The majority of small-and medium-sized municipalities (SMMs) are either stalling at the stage of developing adaptation plans or are not yet engaged in adaptation at all. Not only confronted with the consequences of climate change but also with limited resources and capacities for adaptation, SMMs face structural as well as political obstacles to the coming decade's imperative of expanding adaptation. This paper takes stock of adaptation in SMMs and reviews known barriers as well as enabling factors across different geographic and thematic areas. The analysis of documented cases highlights a research bias toward organisation for economic co-operation and development (OECD) countries and, thematically, on multilevel governance challenges for SMM adaptation. Recent trends as part of a 'second phase' of adaptation that extends to SMM are a move from adaptation planning to implementation. In scoping out knowledge gaps requiring further research, the review explores areas of opportunity and mechanisms for supporting and upscaling SMM adaptation efforts in the near future.","[Fuenfgeld, Hartmut; Fila, Dennis; Dahlmann, Heindriken] Univ Freiburg, Inst Environm Social Sci & Geog, Schreiberstr 20, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany; [Fuenfgeld, Hartmut] RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, 124 LaTrobe St, Melbourne 3001, Australia",University of Freiburg; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Funfgeld, H (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Environm Social Sci & Geog, Schreiberstr 20, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany.;Funfgeld, H (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, 124 LaTrobe St, Melbourne 3001, Australia.",hartmut.fuenfgeld@geographie.uni-freiburg.de,,,"German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV) [67DAS204]","German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV)","Acknowledgements The research for this review paper was conducted with financial support from the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV) (financial support no. 67DAS204) , for which the authors are very grateful.

The situation of mountain communities in the Pamir and Tien Shan mountains in Central Asia is exacerbated by remote location, difficult access, and poorly maintained infrastructure as well as by a distinctly continental climate. Designing and implementing climate adaptation policies for mountainous Central Asia is hindered by the limited understanding of a wide range of environmental and socio-ecological parameters. In particular, there are major knowledge gaps on the temperature and precipitation trends in high altitudes of the Pamir and Tien Shan mountains which are the result of poor and frequently unreliable data. These knowledge and date constraints have a negative effect also on forecasting the occurrence and intensity of extreme weather events which constitute a major hazard for local communities residing in the mountain foothills. This study reviews the state of research on climate change and climate change adaptation in mountainous Central Asia, also considering temperature and precipitation projections for the region. This includes an outline of the geophysical and socio-economic conditions of mountainous Central Asia as well as a survey of climate adaptation initiatives and policies currently implemented in the Pamir and Tien Shan mountain region with special consideration of their limitations and challenges. Knowledge gaps and data constraints, especially on climate-glacier-water and hazard interactions, are identified, and research and policy measures are suggested based on the study findings for improving climate change adaptation in mountainous Central Asia.","[Xenarios, Stefanos] Nazarbayev Univ, Grad Sch Publ Policy, Kabanbaybatyr Ave 53,Block C3,42, Astana 010000, Kazakhstan; [Xenarios, Stefanos; Hergarten, Chris; Shigaeva, Jyldyz; Foggin, Marc] Univ Cent Asia, Mt Soc Res Inst, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; [Gafurov, Abror] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Hydrol 5 4, Potsdam, Germany; [Schmidt-Vogt, Dietrich] Freiburg Univ, Chair Silviculture, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Freiburg, Germany; [Sehring, Jenniver] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Integrated Water Syst & Governance Dept, Delft, Netherlands; [Sehring, Jenniver] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Manandhar, Sujata] Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Manandhar, Sujata] Yukon Coll, Yukon Res Ctr, Whitehorse, YT, Canada; [Hergarten, Chris] Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, Bern, Switzerland; [Foggin, Marc] Univ British Columbia, Inst Asian Res, Vancouver, BC, Canada",Nazarbayev University; University of Central Asia; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; University of Freiburg; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; University of Helsinki; University of Saskatchewan; Yukon University; University of Bern; University of British Columbia,"Xenarios, S (corresponding author), Nazarbayev Univ, Grad Sch Publ Policy, Kabanbaybatyr Ave 53,Block C3,42, Astana 010000, Kazakhstan.;Xenarios, S (corresponding author), Univ Cent Asia, Mt Soc Res Inst, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.",stefanos.xenarios@nu.edu.kz; gafurov@gfz-potsdam.de; dietrich.schmidt-vogt@waldbau.uni-freiburg.de; j.sehring@un-ihe.org; sujatamanandhar@gmail.com; christian.hergarten@ucentralasia.org; zhyldyz.shigaeva@ucentralasia.org; marc.foggin@ucentralasia.org,"Sehring, Jenniver/AAB-3360-2021; Gafurov, Abror/AAQ-9362-2021; Foggin, Marc/W-3277-2019","Foggin, Marc/0000-0002-2663-6715; Sehring, Jenniver/0000-0002-0523-7256",,,,,89,42,42,2,40,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

This article explores pastoral adaptation strategies at the rural-urban interface. It examines how Maasai pastoralists in peri-urban Nairobi, Kenya, respond to climate hazards in the context of urban expansion, land use change, and land privatisation. Using mixed-method research, the study is informed by a household survey (n = 72), 38 qualitative interviews, and 12 focus group discussions. Drawing on the literature on climate change adaptation, pastoral change, and peri-urban dynamics, we find that while urban expansion provides significant challenges for pastoral livelihoods in the study area, pastoralists also engage new opportunities in the peri-urban context and employ them in their adaptation strategies. We show how adaptation strategies related to mobility, diversification, market exchange, and storage are employed through a variety of efforts including engagement with urban land markets and demand for livestock products, and by capitalising on proximity to transport, trading facilities, water, and commercial fodder. Communal pooling, another adaptation strategy, is less used and perceived to be in decline. We further find that historical land ownership patterns play a significant role in adaptation strategies, as pastoralists who have benefitted from rangeland privatisation are able to convert high peri-urban land values into private rural land access and investments in, e.g. diversification. Poor households are in a more precarious position but draw on informal agreements to access land as part of their adaptation strategies. Our findings highlight how pastoral households at the rural-urban interface may draw actively on peri-urban opportunities in their adaptation strategies as part of their efforts to enhance livelihoods, and in so doing bridge peri-urban and rural space. More broadly, our study highlights the importance of understanding pastoral climate change adaptation in the context of wider changes in livelihoods, land use, and land rights, rather than as isolated actions.

However, there are few examples in which adaptation has been successfully implemented, evidencing the need for improving understanding about the socio-institutional context of adaptation processes and the underlying causes of barriers to adaptation. In this research, we developed a stakeholder-based assessment of barriers to the adoption of climate adaptation options for irrigation in the Guadiana basin, one of Spain's most climate-vulnerable basins. Based on social network mapping, we elicited potential barriers to adaptation in the water sector. Using stakeholder questionnaires, we assessed the impact of the identified barriers on the implementation of selected adaptation measures. Results highlight the low acceptance of planned adaptation by stakeholders, and the lack of awareness and of a common understanding among the different actors as preeminent barriers to adaptation, potentially caused by insufficient interactions between water users, the scientific community and environmental groups. The role of the government as a catalyst of those interactions can be crucial for overcoming those barriers. Acknowledged water management instruments, such as water tariffs and quotas, may face the greatest barriers, while widely accepted adaptation measures, such as irrigation modernisation, can contribute to overcoming the obstacles for the implementation of more controversial measures. Overall, the results of this research contribute to climate change adaptation providing a better understanding of the social dimension of adaptation processes, potential barriers to overcome and the feasibility of specific measures.","[Esteve, Paloma; Varela-Ortega, Consuelo] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Agr Econ Stat & Management, Madrid, Spain; [Esteve, Paloma; Varela-Ortega, Consuelo] Univ Politecn Madrid, Res Ctr Management Agr & Environm Risks, Madrid, Spain; [Downing, Thomas E.] Global Climate Adaptat Partnership, Oxford, England",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Esteve, P (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Agr Econ Stat & Management, Madrid, Spain.;Esteve, P (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Res Ctr Management Agr & Environm Risks, Madrid, Spain.",paloma.esteve@upm.es; consuelo.varela@upm.es; TDowning@ClimateAdaptation.cc,"Esteve, Paloma/Y-6746-2019","Esteve, Paloma/0000-0003-1216-9156","European Commission through the MEDIATION project (Methodology for Effective Decision-Making on Impacts and Adaptation FP7, Small Collaborative Project, European Commission, DG Research, Project) [244012]; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid through a PhD scholarship of UPM RD Programme","European Commission through the MEDIATION project (Methodology for Effective Decision-Making on Impacts and Adaptation FP7, Small Collaborative Project, European Commission, DG Research, Project); Universidad Politecnica de Madrid through a PhD scholarship of UPM RD Programme","This research was funded by the European Commission through the MEDIATION project (Methodology for Effective Decision-Making on Impacts and Adaptation FP7, Small Collaborative Project, European Commission, DG Research, Project No. 244012, 2010-2013), and co-funded by Universidad Politecnica de Madrid through a PhD scholarship of UPM R&D Programme.",,55,14,14,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Continuing climate risks require adaptation at all levels of society. The densely populated and resource-rich coastal zone of Bangladesh is at risk to the impacts of climate change. Design/methodology/approach This research is based on secondary sources (gray and published literature) of information on climate change impacts on the coastal zone of Bangladesh. The sources include research reports, online publications, governmental reports, scientific journals, international reports, books, journal articles and other academic resources on SEA, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and DRR. In addition to examining SEA in Bangladesh, this paper investigates SEA cases in different countries to obtain insights from the successful application of SEA for CCA. Findings The paper draws on several cases from different countries demonstrating that SEA has a significant potential to coordinate CCA objectives. The findings reveal that the appropriate use of SEA can enable DRR through CCA. Originality/value This study argues that SEA has a potential role in supporting CCA.","[Islam, Md.

We posit this problem as a function of the attributes of adaptation policy making, including deep uncertainty and nonstationarity, where past observations are not reliable predictors of future outcomes. Our research links organizational decision-making attributes with adaptation decision making and identifies cases in which adaptation actions cause spillovers, free riding, and distributional impacts. We develop a governing framework for adaptation that we believe will enable policy, planning, and major long-term development decisions to be made appropriately at all levels of government in the face of the deep uncertainty and nonstationarity caused by climate change. Our framework requires that approval of projects with an expected life span of 30 years or more in the built environment include minimum building standards that integrate forecasted climate change impacts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) intermediate scenario. The intermediate IPCC scenario must be downscaled to include local or regional temperature, water availability, sea level rise, susceptibility to forest fires, and human habitation impacts to minimize climate-change risks to the built environment. The minimum standard is systematically updated every six years to facilitate learning by formal and informal organizations. As a minimum standard, the governance framework allows jurisdictions to take stronger actions to increase their climate resilience and thus maintain system flexibility.","[Mazmanian, Daniel A.] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Jurewitz, John] Pomona Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Nelson, Hal T.] Claremont Grad Univ, Claremont, CA USA",University of Southern California; Claremont Colleges; Pomona College; Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School,"Mazmanian, DA (corresponding author), Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,,,,,56,13,13,0,38,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

This problem is aggravated by the effects of climate change, with the increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather phenomena in this region. In light of this situation, the local governments, in collaboration with the concessionaire companies providing supply and sewage services, are committed to adopting measures aimed at a more efficient management of non-conventional water resources. Examples of good practice for reducing urban flood risk and adapting to climate change are those actions developed in the tourist municipalities of Alicante, Torrevieja, and Benidorm, where measures have been implemented or have been planned and integrated with green spaces, with a commitment to sustainability, such as sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) or Nature-Based Solutions (NBSs). This study analyses these case studies, based on a detailed review of the technical projects that contemplate each of the actions. Furthermore, several field trips were made with technical personnel who are familiar with the measures adopted. The results show that the implementation of these systems contributes to advancing the reduction of urban flood risk and the adaptation to climate change, creating more resilient and safer urban spaces for the citizens residing in them.","[Sanchez-Almodovar, Esther] Univ Alicante, Interuniv Inst Geog, Water & Terr Res Grp, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03690, Spain; [Olcina-Cantos, Jorge; Prieto-Cerdan, Antonio] Univ Alicante, Dept Reg Geog Anal & Phys Geog, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03690, Spain; [Marti-Talavera, Javier] Univ Alicante, Interuniv Inst Geog, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03690, Spain; [Padilla-Blanco, Ascension] Univ Alicante, CIBIO Res Inst, Ctr Iberoamer Biodivers, Environm Soc & Landscape Res Grp MedsPai, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03690, Spain",,"Sanchez-Almodavar, E (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Interuniv Inst Geog, Water & Terr Res Grp, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03690, Spain.",esther.sanchez@ua.es,"Olcina, Jorge/H-2447-2015","Olcina, Jorge/0000-0002-4846-8126",,,,,81,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,FEB,2023,15,4,,,,,,,807,10.3390/w15040807,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15040807,,,26,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,9M1PX,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000942011100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The integration of CCA in core DRR operations is crucial to provide simultaneous benefits for social systems coping with challenges posed by climate extremes and climate change. Although state actors are generally responsible for governing a public issue such as CCA and DRR integration, the reform of top-down governing modes in neoliberal societies has enlarged the range of potential actors to include non state actors from economic and social communities. These new intervening actors require in-depth investigation. To achieve this goal, the article investigates the set of actors and their bridging arrangements that create and shape governance in CCA and DRR integration. The article conducts a comprehensive literature review in order to retrieve main actors and arrangements. The article summarizes actors and arrangements into a conceptual governance framework that can be used as a backdrop for future research on the topic. However, this framework has an explorative form, which must be refined according to site- and context-specific variables, norms, or networks. Accordingly, this article promotes an initial application of the framework to different contexts. Scholars may adopt the framework as a roadmap with which to corroborate the existence of a theoretical and empirical body of knowledge on governance of CCA and DRR integration.","[Forino, Giuseppe; von Meding, Jason; Brewer, Graham J.] Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Forino, G (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Univ Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",Giuseppe.forino@newcastle.edu.au,,"forino, giuseppe/0000-0001-6659-0742",University of Newcastle,University of Newcastle,"Giuseppe Forino is supported by a PhD scholarship from the University of Newcastle.

Adapting to climate change: Guidance for the management of inland glacial lake fisheries. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. Climate change is altering glacial lake fisheries in the United States, presenting a complex challenge for fisheries managers. Here we provide a regional perspective to guide management of heterogeneous and yet interdependent fishery resources in glacial lakes of the upper Midwest. Our main objective was to promote the adaptation of inland glacial lakes fisheries management to climate change by outlining processes that support regional plans. Using examples from the glacial lakes region, we outline an approach for regional prioritization, specify strategies for moving from regional prioritization to on-the-ground action, and provide guidance on the implementation of management plans given resource limitations and potential stakeholder conflict. We find that integrating ecological, social, and economic data with climate change vulnerability assessments can be useful in generating lake-priority levels to help identify where to focus actions to support system resilience. Managers can use lake-priority levels and ecosystem-specific strategies to make decisions about where and when to apply fisheries management action ranging from traditional (i.e., stocking, harvest regulations) to nontraditional approaches (i.e., catchment land management). Although the implementation of several approaches may be beyond an agency's financial and logistical capacity, funds can be secured through other sources ranging from grant programs to nontraditional partnerships identified by thinking outside the lake. Regional plans may be an important step toward successful climate adaptation for inland glacial lakes fisheries management, and the proactive efforts of managers may help facilitate their development and implementation.","[Tingley, Ralph W., III] Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resources, Missouri Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, 302 Anheuser Busch Nat Resources Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Paukert, Craig] Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resources, US Geol Survey, Missouri Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Columbia, MO USA; [Sass, Greg G.] Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, Off Appl Sci, Escanaba Lake Res Stn, Boulder Jct, WI USA; [Jacobson, Peter C.] Minnesota Dept Nat Resources, Pk Rapids, MN USA; [Hansen, Gretchen J.

For climate change adaptation, it is essential to quantify the public's perceptions of climate change. This study employs the concept of risk perception and psychological distance to understand the role of the built environment in shaping public perception. An index-based approach was used to quantify climate change risk perception and psychological distance using indicators from disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation literature. Risk perception was constructed using three dimensions, i.e., fear, attitude, and trust, while for psychological distancing, four dimensions were used, i.e., geographic, social, temporal, and uncertainty. Local climate zone (LCZ) using WUDAPT procedure was used to identify five different built environments of Islamabad, Pakistan. Statistical tests were performed to find differences between the selected indicators and dimensions. Pearson's correlation was used to establish the link between risk perception and psychological distancing. Results showed that there was a significant difference in risk perception and psychological distancing indicators among the LCZs. A strong negative correlation was found between risk perception and psychological distancing to climate change indexes. This study advocates the importance of the built environment in shaping public perceptions of climate change risks. This pivotal study can help in integrating the philosophies of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation.","[Aslam, Ayman; Rana, Irfan Ahmad] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, H-12 Sect, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan,"Rana, IA (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, H-12 Sect, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.",ayman.aslam96@gmail.com; irfanrana90@hotmail.com,"Rana, Irfan Ahmad/C-2560-2017","Rana, Irfan Ahmad/0000-0002-3157-1186",,,,,81,3,3,18,39,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

It will have greatest, and generally earliest, impact on the poorest and most disadvantaged populations on the planet. Changes in climatic conditions and increases in weather variability affect human wellbeing, safety, health and survival in many ways. Some impacts are direct-acting and immediate, such as impaired food yields and storm surges. Other health effects are less immediate and typically occur via more complex causal pathways that involve a range of underlying social conditions and sectors such as water and sanitation, agriculture and urban planning. Climate change adaptation is receiving much attention given the inevitability of climate change and its effects, particularly in developing contexts, where the effects of climate change will be experienced most strongly and the response mechanisms are weakest. Financial support towards adaptation activities from various actors including the World Bank, the European Union and the United Nations is increasing substantially. With this new global impetus and funding for adaptation action come challenges such as the importance of developing adaptation activities on a sound understanding of baseline community needs and vulnerabilities, and how these may alter with changes in climate. The global health community is paying heed to the strengthening focus on adaptation, albeit in a slow and unstructured manner. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of adaptation and its relevance to global health, and highlight the opportunities to improve health and reduce health inequities via the new and additional funding that is available for climate change adaptation activities.","[Bowen, Kathryn J.; Friel, Sharon] Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia; Univ Melbourne, Dept Resource Management & Geog, Carlton, Vic 3010, Australia",Australian National University; University of Melbourne,"Bowen, KJ (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",kathryn.bowen@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,43,24,24,0,55,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1744-8603,,GLOBALIZATION HEALTH,Global.

Climate adaptation strategies are therefore needed, since mitigation strategies alone are not sufficient to avoid serious impacts of climate change. However, adaptation to climate change is not straightforward, as it is highly influenced by diverse and conflicting interests as well as epistemological (or scientific) uncertainties. Therefore, a minimum requirement for its success is the active participation of stakeholders and citizens in the adaptation policy cycle. This paper presents a case study on a participatory process involving civil servants from different municipalities in Malaysia, in Southeast Asia, with a view to considering the optimal level of engagement that is required for climate adaptation planning. The exercise consisted of a Focus Group session, where participants were asked to discuss the level of stakeholder and citizen participation that should be adopted within the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy initiative. Contrary to authors' expectations, the participants tended to suggest medium to high levels of participation in the planning process. During the dialogues, a walking activity through the city, aimed at identifying hotspots of climate risks and defined as safety walks, was one of the ideas proposed as a high-potential participatory method, spreading in the adaptation framework. Safety walks could complement climate modelling and enhance the robustness of climate risk assessments.","[Palermo, Valentina; Hernandez, Yeray] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Palermo, V (corresponding author), European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy.",valentina.palermo@ec.europa.eu; yeray.hernandez@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,99,6,6,0,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We test this assumption as it applies at the scale of households, through a study of the relationship between adaptive capacity and household actions to adapt to wildfire risk in Mount Dandenong, Australia. Here we show a weak relationship exists between adaptive capacity and adaptation, such that high adaptive capacity does not clearly result in a correspondingly high level of adaptation. Three factors appear to mediate the relationship between household adaptive capacity and adaptation: their attitude to risk, their experience of risk, and their expectations of authorities. The findings suggest that to understand the adaptation practices of households, greater attention needs to be paid to socio-psychological factors that trigger people to apply their available capacities.","[Mortreux, Colette; Barnett, Jon] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [O'Neill, Saffron] Univ Exeter, Geog, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Melbourne; University of Exeter,"Barnett, J (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",c.mortreux@outlook.com; S.ONeill@exeter.ac.uk; jbarn@unimelb.edu.au,"Barnett, Jon/AAQ-9002-2021","Barnett, Jon/0000-0002-0862-0808; Mortreux, Colette/0000-0001-6855-4139",Australian Research Council [FT120100208]; Australian Research Council [FT120100208] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),Thanks to Pia Treichel for her critical appraisal of this manuscript.

Public policy scholars have recently suggested to study such attempts by conceptualizing policy integration as a multi-dimensional process. Although such a processual perspective has helped to comparatively assess policy (dis)integration, the mechanisms of (dis)integration over time remain undertheorized. Past studies have reported a number of relevant factors, but these have remained rather functionalistic observations that lack explanatory value. To address this gap, we propose a mechanism-based approach that uncovers the political processes that underlie policy (dis)integration over time. Rooted in different strands of social science literature, the mechanistic approach offers a model of causation to assess the plausible chain of key processes that are triggered under particular contextual conditions. We illustrate the framework by empirically investigating the mechanisms that explain the policy (dis)integration of food and climate change adaptation policy in the Netherlands. We end the paper with discussing various implications of our findings for processual approaches to policy integration.","[Biesbroek, Robbert; Candel, Jeroen J.

Using a case study, we focus on the relationship between labor migration, agrarian livelihood diversification, and climate change to further a more nuanced understanding of migration as adaptation than is implied by a simple dichotomy of success versus failure. Smallholder diversification, both on- and off-farm, has largely been framed as a risk spreading practice that lowers climate change vulnerability. But after decades of advocating livelihood diversification, with labor migration now increasingly a part of smallholder livelihood activities, it is urgent to pose a number of questions: Why do smallholders migrate? How does labor migration unfold for them and with what outcomes? Our primary goal here is to explore the nature of the relationship of labor migration to climate change and climate change adaptation. Through empirical fieldwork in northwestern Nicaragua, we explore the role of labor migration in smallholder household production and reproduction, as families confront increasingly difficult climatic conditions for agricultural production and a relative absence of the state within a neoliberal political economy. Our analysis draws on household surveys and qualitative interviews and focus groups we carried out in the municipality of Somotillo, in northwestern Nicaragua, over three years (2013-15). Our findings demonstrate that household labor migration neither facilitates adaptation to climate change nor reflects a failure to adapt, but rather reflects the weak position of smallholders in interlocking relations of power and the relative land scarcity experienced by many. We argue that labor migration barely maintains semi-subsistence agricultural production and reinforces existing social inequalities, raising questions regarding a conceptualization of migration as adaptation and the benefits of this type of livelihood diversification.

China's regulatory planning remains the basis for building permission in the original urban and rural planning, and the new territorial spatial planning systems, determining the quality of urban plan implementation. Comprehensive regulatory plans effectively reduce carbon emissions. This study employs Q methodology to compare and analyze urban planners' and practitioners' perceptions of China's regulatory planning in climate change mitigation and adaptation. The findings show that while regulatory planning is key, potential deficiencies include the gaps between regulatory from master plans, capacity shortages of designations and indicators, and unequal rights and responsibilities of local governments. However, mandatory indicators in regulatory planning, especially greening rate, building density, land use type, and application of renewable energy technologies to the development of municipal infrastructure could effectively mitigate climate change. Greening rate is the core indicator in regulatory planning since it provides empirical evidence for the green space effect. This study indicates that local customization of combined regulation of greening rate and green spaces could help mitigate and help China adapt to climate change.","[Yin, Chengzhi; Xiao, Jianhua; Zhang, Tianqi] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Xiao, JH (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",yincz@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn; xiaojh20@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; zhangtianqi@tju.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Fund of China [20AGL029],National Social Science Fund of China,"This research was funded by National Social Science Fund of China, grant number 20AGL029.",,46,1,1,15,46,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2021,13,17,,,,,,,9701,10.3390/su13179701,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13179701,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UO2PV,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000694542700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Social-ecological systems are usually researched at one of two spatial scales: local placed-based empirical studies or system-scale modelling, with limited efforts to date exploring the merits of combining these two analytical approaches and scales. Here, we take a multiscale interdisciplinary approach to elucidate the social dynamics underpinning cross-sectoral feedbacks and unintended consequences of decision-making that can affect social-ecological system vulnerability unexpectedly. We combined empirical place-based research with the Robustness Framework, a dynamic system level analysis platform, to analyse the characteristics and robustness of a coastal SES in Cornwall, UK. Embedding place-based empirical analysis into a broader institutional framework revealed SES feedbacks and maladaptations. We find that decentralisation efforts coupled with government austerity measures amplify second-order (reputational) risks. This prompted temporal policy trade-offs, which increased individual and community vulnerability and reduced social-ecological system robustness, impeding local adaptation to climate change. We identify opportunities to ameliorate these maladaptations by (1) implementing coordination rules that can guide policymakers in instances of conflicting coastal management pressures, and (2) recognising how second-order risks influence decision-making. This work demonstrates the strengths of combining local and regional analyses to assess the robustness of social-ecological systems exposed to environmental changes, such as climate change and sea level rise. Our results show how analysis of the multiscale effects of climate policies, decision-making processes and second-order risks can usefully support local climate change adaptation planning.","[Naylor, Larissa A.] Univ Glasgow, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Brady, Ute] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ USA; [Quinn, Tara; Brown, Katrina] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Geog, Exeter, Devon, England; [Anderies, John Marty] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ USA",University of Glasgow; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Exeter; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Naylor, LA (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",larissa.naylor@glasgow.ac.uk; ubrady@asu.edu; T.quinn@exeter.ac.uk; katrina.brown@exeter.ac.uk; m.anderies@asu.edu,"; Naylor, Larissa/E-7301-2014","Quinn, Tara/0000-0002-5375-6085; Brown, Katrina/0000-0002-5426-5288; Naylor, Larissa/0000-0002-4065-2674","Belmont Forum [NE/L008807/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/M010546/1]; NERC [NE/L008807/1, NE/M010546/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Belmont Forum; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),The authors would like to acknowledge support from the Belmont Forum (NE/L008807/1) and Natural Environment Research Council (NE/M010546/1) for funding this research.,,51,15,15,3,36,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

We show how Vanuatu is progressing the ideals of integration in practice, in its policy and legislation, its institutional arrangements, and the resourcing it is allocating to integrating disaster risk management and climate change adaptation.

The study was carried out in Chirumhanzu district in Zimbabwe and used a mixed methods approach combining 217 household surveys, targeted focus group discussions, participatory learning actions methods, key informant interviews and a document review. Household data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences and thematic content analysis was used for the qualitative data. We found that the majority of households showed awareness of several risk reduction and adaptation strategies to implement during and/or when drought was predicted, with 56% of the respondents stating stocking of grain as initial strategy. Other strategies adopted at household level included early planting (at first rains), conservation farming, planting small grains and dry planting. Indigenous and traditional knowledge systems and practices, including local people's holistic view of the community and environment, were a major resource for adapting to climate change and drought risks. However, these indigenous knowledge systems and practices had not been consistently used in the existing adaptation and risk-reduction efforts. Indigenous knowledge was not sufficiently acknowledged and integrated into formal risk reduction and adaptation strategies, which resulted in limited success for external interventions. There is need for integration of local and indigenous knowledge systems and external interventions to build household livelihoods that are resilient to climate risks.","[Grey, Mashoko S.] CSR Grp Africa Consultancy Pvt Ltd, Dept Res, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Masunungure, Current] Nelson Mandela Univ, Fac Sci, Sustainabil Res Unit, Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Manyani, Amanda] Stellenbosch Univ, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Ctr Complex Syst Transit, Stellenbosch, South Africa",Nelson Mandela University; Stellenbosch University,"Grey, MS (corresponding author), CSR Grp Africa Consultancy Pvt Ltd, Dept Res, Harare, Zimbabwe.",mashgrey@gmail.com,,,,,,,49,0,0,5,11,AFRICAN CENTRE DISASTER STUDIES,POTCHEFSTROOM,"INTERNAL BOX 265, NORTH-WEST UNIV, PRIVATE BAG X6001, POTCHEFSTROOM, 2520, SOUTH AFRICA",1996-1421,2072-845X,,JAMBA-J DISASTER RIS,Jamba-J.

Adaptation is needed to counteract anticipated drawbacks of climate change on crop and livestock productivity; therefore, we examined climate change perceptions of pastoralists and agro-pastoralists and analysed their adaptation strategies. To this end, focus group discussions were held in six villages distributed across three agro-ecological zones. In three of these sites, 162 farmers were also individually interviewed. Perceptions of farmers were compared to actual trends of different climatic parameters extracted from official long-term meteorological records (1988-2008). Results showed that farmers in Burkina Faso were partly aware of climate change, particularly of changes in temperature and rainfall patterns, but their perception did not match well with the recorded annual rainfall data in the southern Sahelian and Sudanian zones. The most important adaptation strategies mentioned by agro-pastoralists were crop diversification, combination of cropping and livestock operations, use of water harvesting technologies and anti-erosive measures such as half-moons or stone dikes. Strategies of pastoralists included seasonal, annual and permanent migration and taking up of cereal cropping. Logistic regression analysis indicated that agro-ecological zone, cultivated surface, ruminant herd size, household size and education were the most important variables affecting farmers' choice of adaptation strategies. These factors should be taken into account in the development and implementation of any programme of adaptation to climate change in Burkina Faso.","[Zampaligre, Nouhoun; Dossa, Luc Hippolyte; Schlecht, Eva] Univ Kassel, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany; [Zampaligre, Nouhoun; Dossa, Luc Hippolyte; Schlecht, Eva] Univ Gottingen, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany",Universitat Kassel; University of Gottingen,"Schlecht, E (corresponding author), Univ Kassel, Steinstr 19, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany.",schlecht@uni-kassel.de,"Dossa, Luc Hippolyte/AAA-8931-2021","Dossa, Luc Hippolyte/0000-0003-1436-0667",,,,,61,65,66,3,74,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

One reason is that traditional (culturally-grounded) autonomous community coping capacity has been overlooked, many external agencies viewing all such communities as both homogenous and helpless. A community's autonomous coping capacity can be proxied by peripherality, a measure of the degree to which a particular community in archipelagic (island) countries engages with core agendas. In order to gauge the depth, breadth and efficacy of autonomous coping capacity, three indices of community peripherality were developed from research within thirteen communities in (peripheral-biased) Bua Province in Fiji. Index 1 concerns geography (travel time/cost to town), Index 2 concerns population and employment (community size, age distribution, employment), and Index 3 concerns tradition and global awareness (mobile phones per capita, traditional/western healthcare preferences, inherent coping capacity, diet, water and energy security).

Current sectoral approaches to climate change adaptation initiatives often create imbalances and retard sustainable development. Regional and international literature on climate change adaptation opportunities and challenges applicable to southern Africa from a water-energy-food (WEF) nexus perspective was reviewed. Specifically, this review highlights climate change impacts on water, energy, and food resources in southern Africa, while exploring mitigation and adaptation opportunities. The review further recommends strategies to develop cross-sectoral sustainable measures aimed at building resilient communities. Regional WEF nexus related institutions and legal frameworks were also reviewed to relate the WEF nexus to policy. Southern Africa is witnessing an increased frequency and intensity in climate change-associated extreme weather events, causing water, food, and energy insecurity. A projected reduction of 20% in annual rainfall by 2080 in southern Africa will only increase the regional socio-economic challenges. This is exacerbating regional resource scarcities and vulnerabilities. It will also have direct and indirect impacts on nutrition, human well-being, and health. Reduced agricultural production, lack of access to clean water, sanitation, and clean, sustainable energy are the major areas of concern. The region is already experiencing an upsurge of vector borne diseases (malaria and dengue fever), and water and food-borne diseases (cholera and diarrhoea). What is clear is that climate change impacts are cross-sectoral and multidimensional, and therefore require cross-sectoral mitigation and adaptation approaches. In this regard, a well-coordinated and integrated WEF nexus approach offers opportunities to build resilient systems, harmonise interventions, and mitigate trade-offs and hence improve sustainability. This would be achieved through greater resource mobilisation and coordination, policy convergence across sectors, and targeting nexus points in the landscape. The WEF nexus approach has potential to increase the resilience of marginalised communities in southern Africa by contributing towards attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 13).","[Mpandeli, Sylvester; Naidoo, Dhesigen; Liphadzi, Stanley] Water Res Commiss South Africa, 4 Daventry St, ZA-0081 Pretoria, South Africa; [Mpandeli, Sylvester] Univ Venda, Sch Environm Sci, Private Bag X 5050, ZA-0950 Thohoyandou, South Africa; [Mabhaudhi, Tafadzwanashe; Hlahla, Sithabile; Modi, Albert T.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, P Bag X01, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Nhemachena, Charles; Nhamo, Luxon] IWMI SA, 141 Creswell St, ZA-0184 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Venda; University of Kwazulu Natal,"Nhamo, L (corresponding author), IWMI SA, 141 Creswell St, ZA-0184 Pretoria, South Africa.",sylvesterm@wrc.org.za; Dhesn@wrc.org.za; Mabhaudhi@ukzn.ac.za; C.Nhemachena@cgiar.org; l.nhamo@cgiar.org; stanleyl@wrc.org.za; hlahlas@ukzn.ac.za; modiat@ukzn.ac.za,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Mabhaudhi, Tafadzwanashe/AAF-2418-2019; Nhamo, Luxon/AAO-1511-2021; Nhamo, Luxon/H-4000-2019","Mabhaudhi, Tafadzwanashe/0000-0002-9323-8127; Nhamo, Luxon/0000-0003-2944-1769; Nhamo, Luxon/0000-0003-2944-1769",Water Research Commission (WRC) through the Research Development Branch,Water Research Commission (WRC) through the Research Development Branch,The research was funded by the Water Research Commission (WRC) through the Research Development Branch.,,70,60,60,9,76,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

In facts, during recent decades scholars are busy assessing its impact now and in the foreseeable future. Within the fragile dryland ecosystem of Sokoto in the North-western part of Nigeria, some of the immediate impacts of climate change includes declining rainfall, increasing temperature and extreme weather events such as droughts, severe windstorms, heat waves and flooding among others. These presents some serious threats to both the natural ecosystem and people depending on the ecosystem for their livelihood particularly crop farmers and livestock pastoralists that constitutes over 70% of the inhabitant of the area. Under this kind of situation, the need for increasing awareness about the causes, impacts, mitigation and adaptation to climate change cannot be over emphasised particularly among farmers and herdsmen due to the high sensitivity of their livelihood sources to climate change. Using a semi-structured questionnaire with both open and close ended questions and simple statistical techniques, this research tries to investigate the level of climate change awareness and adaptation strategies among farmers and herdsmen in the Sokoto Close-settled Zone of North-western Nigeria. The result revealed a fair level of awareness of climate change particularly amongst the youth in the area.

In the context of the South Pacific Island Countries and their reliance on marine resources, this paper outlines the urgent need for exploring alternative ecosystem valuation methodology. The objective behind alternative ecosystem valuation methodology is to enable a more comprehensive identification and elicitation of the various types of ecosystem values. This paper demonstrates how the commonly adopted monetary approach to conducting ecosystem valuation impedes the exploration of climate change adaptation strategies based on non-monetary aspects. These include value-indicators such as time, labour, geographical distance and collective community efforts along with social value, e.g. community incentives to protect and sustain local ecosystems. The paper compares and contrasts various combinations of ecosystem valuation methods that can enable social and non-monetary valuation of ecosystems in low-income settings that reflect social norms and cultural value systems. The paper concludes with a discussion of how alternative ecosystem valuation methodology can enable new pathways towards climate change adaptation and the improvement of living standards that would be particularly suitable for low-income settings where natural resources are vulnerable and financial resources scarce.

Examples are drawn from a survey of statutory regulations, guiding principles and organisational documents shaping current practice, with particular emphasis on the water and conservation sectors of industrialised nations. In so far as it is possible to distil recurring themes into common traits, nine hallmarks are identified. These include visionary leadership, objective setting, risk and vulnerability assessment, guidance for practitioners, organisational learning, low-regret adaptive management, multi-partner working, monitoring and reporting progress and effective communication. Recognising that adaptation is highly context and scale dependent, an organisation might not necessarily exhibit all these features.

Daily weather data up to the year 2090 were downscaled to the district from Global Climate Model outputs under the emission scenarios A2 and B2 published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change using the Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM 4.2). The DSSAT model was applied to simulate future rice yields from four rice varieties grown in the district under three different planting dates: (1) planting in May-the base condition; (2) advancing the planting date by 1 month, i.e., to June; and (3) planting 1 month earlier, i.e., in April. Results show that the seasonally averaged dry season rice yield would increase compared to the base condition when the planting date is advanced by 1 month and, on the other hand, the seasonally averaged rice yield would decrease compared to the base condition when the planting date is delayed by 1 month for all four varieties under both A2 and B2 scenarios. Advancing the rice planting date by 1 month for all four rice varieties can be identified as a non-cost climate change adaptation strategy for rice production in Kurunegala district.","[Dharmarathna, W.

Using general background information on the evolution of CCA research and a case study, we specifically examine how the set of attributes have been manifested in research serving CCA and discuss how they have affected the resulting policy recommendations. We conclude that research serving CCA can be improved by more explicit reflection on the attributes that pay attention to the context of application, the methods of teamwork and a variety of participating organizations, transdisciplinarity of the research, reflexivity based on the values and labour ethos of scientists and novel forms of extended peer review. Such attributes can provide a necessary, although not sufficient, condition for knowledge production that strives to bridge the gap between research and policy.","[Tuomenvirta, Heikki; Gregow, Hilppa; Harjanne, Atte; Luhtala, Sanna; Makela, Antti; Pilli-Sihvola, Karoliina] Finnish Meteorol Inst, POB 503, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Ecosyst & Environm Res Program, POB 65, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci HELSUS, POB 65, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Hilden, Mikael] Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, Latokartanonkaari 11, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland; [Peltonen-Sainio, Pirjo] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Latokartanonkaari 9, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland; [Miettinen, Ilkka T.] Natl Inst Hlth & Welf THL, POB 95, FI-70701 Kuopio, Finland; [Halonen, Mikko] Gaia Consulting Oy, FI-00120 Helsinki, Finland",Finnish Meteorological Institute; University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; Finnish Environment Institute; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Finland National Institute for Health & Welfare,"Tuomenvirta, H (corresponding author), Finnish Meteorol Inst, POB 503, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland.",heikki.tuomenvirta@fmi.fi,"Juhola, Sirkku/GVS-5485-2022; Gregow, Hilppa/AAI-5864-2021; Mäkelä, Antti/GOP-0320-2022","Mäkelä, Antti/0000-0002-2977-0952; Peltonen-Sainio, Pirjo/0000-0002-1083-2201; Juhola, Sirkku/0000-0003-0095-2282","Government of Finland's analysis, assessment and research activities for 2015; Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation","Government of Finland's analysis, assessment and research activities for 2015; Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation","This research was funded by the Government of Finland's analysis, assessment and research activities for 2015.

Worldwide, these so-called climate services are emerging as an essential tool to connect the advances in climate science with the domains of climate change adaptation. The methodology developed within the CLARITY project (funded through European Union funding program Horizon 2020) is aimed at implementing a new generation of climate services specifically designed to assess adaptation measures at the city level under the effects of extreme weather events in the context of climate change. These effects are assessed based on observations as well as climate projections, and the subsequent derivation of climate indices to address changes in climate extremes. The dynamical-statistical downscaling of regional climate model results is used to obtain this information on fine spatial scales (100 m), hence providing urban scale projections and enabling climate sensitivity simulations of adaptation measures on the urban scale. The climate adaptation strategies encompass, among others, green roofs, increasing roof albedo, as well as changes in soil sealing. Here, the climate assessment methodology developed within CLARITY will be discussed in detail, and results for the city of Linz (Austria) presented.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on combined qualitative and quantitative research methods and data. First, the paper draws on qualitative data generated from in-depth interviews and focus group discussions from purposively sampled farmers in the Atankwidi basin. It also draws on a survey conducted on 131 systematically and randomly sampled households in three communities of the basin, namely Yua, Pungu and Mirigu. Findings - The results show that farmers are planting multiple indigenous drought resilient crop varieties and employing different rounds of seeding and or staggering planting between multiple farms. They are also applying indigenous forms of organic manure, checking soil erosion through grass strips and stone terracing and adopting paddy farming for improving soil and water conservation towards enhancing plant adaptation to drought. The paper therefore, asserts that through conscientious effort, farmers are reducing vulnerability of rain-fed agriculture to drought through indigenous knowledge systems of drought risk management. Practical implications - The paper recommends that capacity for managing vulnerability to drought at the local level, including the Atankwidi basin, can be enhanced by incorporating as into District Development Planning (DDP) and giving priority to the strategic role of IKS in climate change adaptation planning. Originality/value - This paper fulfills a need for researching the relevance of IKS for reducing vulnerability of rain-fed agriculture to drought in particular, and enhancing adaptation to climate. change in general in the quest for promoting Endogenous Development (ED) in Africa.","Univ Dev Studies, Planning & Management Dept, Fac Planning & Land Management, Wa, Ghana",University for Development Studies,"Derbile, EK (corresponding author), Univ Dev Studies, Planning & Management Dept, Fac Planning & Land Management, Wa, Ghana.",derbile_uds@hotmail.com,,,,,,,59,24,26,2,73,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

The different roles played by policy actors and their interactions shape the process of adaptation governance. Nevertheless, to date, there has been limited attention paid to how the structure of relations and their associated power dynamics between these actors affect adaptation governance process at different levels. In this study, we analyzed the structure, processes, and power dynamics entailed in the multilevel governance of adaptation to floods in coastal areas of Bangladesh. We used social network analysis approach to map and unpack the interactions between actors that influence the adaptation governance. We categorized five types of organizations based on the structural attributes of the governance network and their functions. Our analysis shows that the organizations with high influence over the governance process reside at the national level and the adaptation governance process is influenced by elite-pluralism. We found that both top-down and bottom-up processes co-exist in different phases of adaptation governance (planning, implementation, and monitoring). Lastly, we conclude that a more equitable redistribution of power (roles and responsibilities) may diminish the negative implications of federal centralization in adaptation governance.","[Ishtiaque, Asif] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Ishtiaque, Asif] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ USA; [Eakin, Hallie] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ USA; [Vij, Sumit] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Vij, Sumit] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Earth & Climate Cluster, Fac Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Chhetri, Netra] Arizona State Univ, Sch Future Innovat Soc, Tempe, AZ USA; [Rahman, Feisal] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham, England; [Huq, Saleemul] Independent Univ, Int Ctr Climate Change & Dev, Dhaka, Bangladesh",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Wageningen University & Research; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Durham University; Independent University Bangladesh (IUB),"Ishtiaque, A (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Ishtiaque, A (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ USA.",Asif.Ishtiaque@asu.edu; Hallie.Eakin@asu.edu; sumit.vij@wur.nl; Netra.Chhetri@asu.edu; feisal1702@gmail.com; saleeumul.huq@iied.org,"Vij, Sumit/AAV-6617-2021","Ishtiaque, Asif/0000-0002-2196-9764; Eakin, Hallie/0000-0001-8253-1320",Matthew G.

The potential impacts of changes in climate and climate variability on these mixed systems are not that well understood, particularly as regards how the food security of vulnerable households may be affected. There are many ways in which the mixed systems may be able to adapt to climate change in the future, including via increased efficiencies of production that sometimes provide important mitigation co-benefits as well.

A qualitative research design was applied, and data were collected through a summative content analysis on 34 policy and legislative documents and 24 key informant interviews (KII). The study found that there are still incoherencies between the current main policy and legislative documents that address CCA, DRR and FS. This study recommends a review of old policy and legislative frameworks promulgated in the 1990s to incorporate cross-cutting issues such as DRR, CCA and FS.

Climate change could cause significant fluctuation in the rain-fed agricultural production due to the spatiotemporal changes in temperature and precipitation. As adjusting sowing dates proved to be an important management technique for improving grain yields, we examined how potato production can be improved by altering planting date in China's semiarid region, thus improving potato adaptation to climate change. Field trials with five target sowing dates (from late April to early June) were carried out in Inner Mongolia, China during four growing seasons (2010-2013), and the effects of sowing dates on potato development, yield and water use efficiency (WUE) were estimated. Results showed that although delayed sowing shortened the duration of potato growth period, non-significant thermal time differences after flowering stage was found among the treatments. However, greater precipitation was shown in three intermediate treatments. Potato yield was significantly affected by sowing dates, and intermediate sowing dates showed greater yield compared to the earlier or later sowing dates. Delayed sowing dates significantly improved WUE in a drier year. As for a normal year, earlier sowing dates promoted WUE because of less water consumption, but these increases came at the cost of reducing yields. Under the current climate conditions in the study area, the flexible sowing time for potato was determined as from early May to early June, and optimum sowing time was between 10 May and 27 May. In conclusion, adjusting sowing date affected duration, thermal time, and precipitation over potato growth period, and the optimal sowing date exhibited higher yield by obtaining greater precipitation, which could improve potato adaption to climate change.","[Hu, Qi; Pan, Xuebiao; Wang, Xiaoxiao; Yang, Pengyu] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Hu, Qi; Pan, Feifei] Univ North Texas, Dept Geog, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Yang, Ning] Beijing Meteorol Bur, Huairou Dist Branch, Beijing 101400, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton,"Pan, XB (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.;Pan, FF (corresponding author), Univ North Texas, Dept Geog, Denton, TX 76203 USA.",s10020292@cau.edu.cn; yangning_2017@163.com; feifei.pan@unt.edu; panxb@cau.edu.cn; wangxiaoxiao0902@126.com; yangpy@163.com,"Pan, Feifei/AAC-5353-2019","Pan, Feifei/0000-0003-4373-7566","National Basic Research Program of China ('973' Program) [2012CB956204]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41475104, 41271053]; National Science & Technology Pillar Program [2012BAD09B02, 2012BAD20B04]",National Basic Research Program of China ('973' Program)(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science & Technology Pillar Program,"This research was funded by National Basic Research Program of China ('973' Program: No. 2012CB956204), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41475104, 41271053), and National Science & Technology Pillar Program during the 12th Five-year Plan Period (No. 2012BAD09B02, 2012BAD20B04).

An adaptation index is used to explore the impact of farmers' adaptation on TE using the stochastic frontier analysis framework. Data for six districts of Nepal representing all three agro-ecological regions (terai, hill, and mountain) were collected from a focus group discussion, a stakeholder workshop and a household survey. The survey shows that about 91% of the farming households have adopted at least one practice to minimize the adverse impacts of climate change. Empirical results reveal that adaptation is an important factor explaining efficiency differentials among farming households. Those adopting a greater number of adaptation practices on a larger scale are, on average, found to be 13% more technically efficient than those adopting fewer practices on smaller scale. The empirical results also show that average TE is only 0.72, indicating that there are opportunities for farming households in Nepal to further improve productive efficiency, on average by 28%. Other important factors that explain variations in the productive efficiency across farming households include farmer's education level, irrigation facilities, market access, and social capital such as farmer's participations in relevant agricultural organizations and clubs. This study provides empirical evidence to policy makers that small scale adjustments made by farmers in response to climate change impacts are effective in improving farmers' efficiency in agriculture production. This indicates a need for farmers' involvement in climate change adaptation planning.","[Khanal, Uttam; Wilson, Clevo; Lee, Boon; Viet-Ngu Hoang] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Wilson, C (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",clevo.wilson@qut.edu.au,"Lee, Boon/K-5178-2019","Lee, Boon/0000-0002-3594-0575; Hoang, Viet-Ngu/0000-0002-9742-2378; Wilson, Clevo/0000-0002-3885-0495",,,,,40,25,25,1,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Utilizing an importance performance analysis (IPA) evaluation framework, this article presents a comparative case study of federal and state land and natural resource manager perceptions of agency performance on factors influencing adaptive capacity in two U.S. regions (northern Colorado and southwestern South Dakota). Results revealed several important findings with substantial management implications. First, none of the managers ranked the adaptive capacity factors as a low priority. Second, managers held the perception that their agencies were performing either neutrally or poorly on most factors influencing adaptive capacity. Third, gap analysis revealed that significant improvements are required to facilitate optimal agency functioning when dealing with climate change-related management issues. Overall, results suggest that a host of institutional and policy-oriented (e.g., lack of clear mandate to adapt to climate change), financial and human resource (e.g., inadequate staff and financial resources), informational (e.g., inadequate research and monitoring programs) and contextual barriers (e.g., sufficient regional networks to mitigate potential transboundary impacts) currently challenge the efficient and effective integration of climate change into decision-making and management within agencies working in these regions. The IPA framework proved to be an effective tool to help managers identify and understand agency strengths, areas of concern, redundancies, and areas that warrant the use of limited funds and/or resource reallocation in order to enhance adaptive capacity and maximize management effectiveness with respect to climate change.

Experts often base their interventions to support farmers to adapt to climate change on their own perception of farmers' livelihood risks. However, if differences in risk perception between farmers and experts exist, these interventions might fail. Thus, for effective design and implementation of adaptation strategies for farmers, it is necessary to understand farmers' perception and how it influences their decision-making. We analyze farmers' and experts' systemic view on climate change threats in relation to other agricultural livelihood risks and assess the differences between their perceptions. For Cauca, Colombia, we found that experts and farmers perceived climate-related and other livelihood risks differently. While farmers' perceived risks were a failure in crop production and lack of access to health and educational services, experts, in contrast, perceived insecurity and the unreliable weather to be the highest risks for farmers. On barriers that prevent farmers from taking action against risks, experts perceived both external factors such as the national policy and internal factors such as the adaptive capacity of farmers to be the main barriers. Farmers ranked the lack of information, especially about weather and climate, as their main barrier to adapt. Effective policies aiming at climate change adaptation need to relate climate change risks to other production risks as farmers often perceive climate change in the context of other risks. Policymakers in climate change need to consider differences in risk perception.","[Eitzinger, Anton] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Km 17,Recta Cali Palmira 6713,Apartado Aereo, Cali 763537, Colombia; [Eitzinger, Anton; Binder, Claudia R.; Meyer, Markus A.] Univ Munich LMU, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Binder, Claudia R.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, ENAC, IIE, Lab Human Environm Relat Urban Syst, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; University of Munich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Eitzinger, A (corresponding author), Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Km 17,Recta Cali Palmira 6713,Apartado Aereo, Cali 763537, Colombia.;Eitzinger, A (corresponding author), Univ Munich LMU, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",a.eitzinger@cgiar.org; claudia.binder@epfl.ch; markus.a.meyer@gmail.com,"Meyer, Markus/AAY-9170-2020; Eitzinger, Anton/AAU-4960-2020; Meyer, Markus/AAV-5608-2020","Eitzinger, Anton/0000-0001-7317-3381; Meyer, Markus/0000-0002-9463-1975; Binder, Claudia, R./0000-0002-2921-9896; Meyer, Markus/0000-0003-4872-7164",CGIAR Fund; International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT); Fundacion Ecohabitats,CGIAR Fund(CGIAR); International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT); Fundacion Ecohabitats,"This work was implemented as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from the CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements.

These events are often known to result in public health disasters, but we can lessen the effects of these disasters. By addressing the factors that cause changes in climate, we can mitigate the effects of climate change. By addressing the factors that make society vulnerable to the effects of climate, we can adapt to climate change. To adapt to climate change, a comprehensive approach to disaster risk reduction has been proposed. By reducing human vulnerability to disasters, we can lessen-and at times even prevent-their impact. Human vulnerability is a complex phenomenon that comprises social, economic, health, and cultural factors. Because public health is uniquely placed at the community level, it has the opportunity to lessen human vulnerability to climate-related disasters. At the national and international level, a supportive policy environment can enable local adaptation to disaster events. The purpose of this article is to introduce the basic concept of disaster risk reduction so that it can be applied to preventing and mitigating the negative effects of climate change and to examine the role of community-focused public health as a means for lessening human vulnerability and, as a result, the overall risk of climate-related disasters.

However, they face major challenges, including global market and demographic shifts, policy changes and climate variations that may threaten the wellbeing, health and safety of fishing communities. Over the years, various forms of spatial management have been implemented in small-scale fisheries as a potential solution to problems afflicting these systems. The benefits of such approaches can be numerous for both ecosystems and coastal communities. In addition to the persistent challenges influencing small-scale fisheries practices, the emerging effects of climate change pose serious risks to coastal ecosystems and fishing communities, especially in low-lying islands. Despite a growing recognition of both the benefits of spatial management and the adverse effects of climate change on small-scale fisheries, integration of these concepts in a consistent and comprehensive way has not yet occurred. Spatial management has the potential to foster small-scale fisheries adaptation to climate change, however, in the face of such a global and transboundary phenomenon, management strategies will need to be carefully designed and implemented. First, key considerations for climate-informed spatial management in small-scale fisheries were identified. Second, these key considerations were illustrated in two selected case studies in Pacific Island countries and territories (i.e. Fiji and Papua New Guinea). Finally, the challenges associated with spatial management in a changing climate are discussed and ways forward for advancing this type of management as a climate adaptation approach for small-scale fisheries in the Pacific and beyond are proposed.","[Le Cornu, Elodie; Doerr, Angee N.; Finkbeiner, Elena M.; Gourlie, Don; Crowder, Larry B.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Ocean Solut, Stanford Woods Inst Environm, 99 Pacific St,Suite 555E, Monterey, CA 93940 USA; [Finkbeiner, Elena M.; Crowder, Larry B.] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University,"Le Cornu, E (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Ctr Ocean Solut, Stanford Woods Inst Environm, 99 Pacific St,Suite 555E, Monterey, CA 93940 USA.",elecornu@stanford.edu,,"Doerr, Angee/0000-0003-4950-4720",,,,,107,14,14,2,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

With reference to the case study of Waihi, the author argues that community resistance to managed retreat is an indicator of the complexity of the political challenges that underpin climate change problems. Adapting to climate change will require more than prescriptive policy solutions. Decision makers also need to rethink democratic processes if they wish to foster deeper community resilience to climate change.

Particular emphasis is given to interpretation of Good Ecological Status in implementing the EU Water Framework Directive, climate adaptation for water management, application of agri-environment measures to reduce agricultural impacts on water and control of discharges from industry. The paper also examines lessons from wider sources of information such as legal analysis of transposition of EU law at national level and the rulings of the European Court of Justice, The analysis identifies a number of different types of 'information' transmission between the different governance scales. Information includes a range of governance issues, including transmission of rules. These are exact 'information' transmission (water quality standards), national elaboration of information transmitted (adapting to climate change), national simplification of information transmitted (industrial pollution control), distributed information transmission On national transposition), fuzzy transmission of information (interpretation of Good Ecological Status) and barriers to transmission (available funding). The paper concludes by considering the importance of cross-scale analysis in assessing policy effectiveness and argues for further analysis drawing on cross-scale research derived from ecosystems analysis.","Inst European Environm Policy, London SW1H 9BU, England",,"Farmer, AM (corresponding author), Inst European Environm Policy, 15 Queen Annes Gate, London SW1H 9BU, England.",afarmer@ieep.eu,,,European Commission [036822],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),The author gratefully acknowledge financial support for the project Water Scenarios for Europe and Neighbouring States (SCENES) from the European Commission (FP6 contract 036822).

Nevertheless, we still know little about how relevant their target groups find them for their work. We aim to address this gap with case studies on two well-known support tools: the Adaptation Wizard from the UK and the Klimalotse from Germany. After showing how adaptation support tools have spread in recent years, we analyze qualitatively how relevant regional and local policy-makers concerned with adaptation find the two tools. One of our main findings is the following discrepancy: while both tools offer support in developing and implementing comprehensive adaptation plans, local policy-makers find this irrelevant and expect support in coping with imminent climate change impacts, for example, by single adaptation measures. Consequently, the local policy-makers we interviewed hardly use the two tools but seek more specific support, in particular regarding vulnerability and cost-benefit assessments. We conclude that policy support tools lack relevance when their well-intended attempt to enlighten target groups is too remote from what the latter expect.","[Clar, Christoph; Steurer, Reinhard] BOKU Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy, Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Clar, C; Steurer, R (corresponding author), BOKU Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, InFER Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",christoph.clar@boku.ac.at; reinhard.steurer@boku.ac.at,,"Clar, Christoph/0000-0003-3556-8256",Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP) [KR13AC6K10993],Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP),"Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP), Grant/Award Number: KR13AC6K10993",,48,14,14,2,14,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",1756-932X,1756-9338,,ENVIRON POLICY GOV,Environ.

Climate change can increase wind speeds, and changes in rainfall and temperature can accelerate timber decay, affecting residual capacity of timber power poles. The present paper utilises advanced stochastic simulation methods to examine climate change impacts, and possible climate change adaptation strategies, for Australian power distribution networks. The assessment framework developed, which is applicable to a wide variety of infrastructure types and research areas, utilises probabilistic methods to investigate the appropriateness of climate adaptation strategies aimed at ameliorating the impact of climate change on critical infrastructure. Measures investigated include alterations to design or maintenance practices through, for example, installation of larger poles, more frequent inspections, or changes to pole replacement criteria. A cost-benefit decision analysis is developed herein using the latest AR5 climate projections, network vulnerability, adaptation measures, and cost and loss data for both direct and indirect costs. The net present value and benefit-to-cost ratio is calculated for different adaptation strategies over the life cycle of the assets up to the year 2090. An adaptation measure that allows for the installation of larger poles but less stringent pole replacement criteria has the highest net benefit-with a mean potential saving of hundreds of millions of dollars.","[Ryan, Paraic C.] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Engn, Discipline Civil Struct & Environm Engn, Cork, Ireland; [Stewart, Mark G.] Univ Newcastle, Ctr Infrastruct Performance & Reliabil, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",University College Cork; University of Newcastle,"Ryan, PC (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, Sch Engn, Discipline Civil Struct & Environm Engn, Cork, Ireland.",Ryanp7@tcd.ie; mark.stewart@newcastle.edu.au,,"Ryan, Paraic/0000-0003-3767-8096; Stewart, Mark/0000-0001-6887-6533",Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Flagship Cluster Fund through the project Climate Adaption Engineering for Extreme Events; Sustainable Cities and Coasts Theme of the CSIRO Climate Adaption Flagship,Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Flagship Cluster Fund through the project Climate Adaption Engineering for Extreme Events; Sustainable Cities and Coasts Theme of the CSIRO Climate Adaption Flagship,"The authors appreciate the financial support of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Flagship Cluster Fund through the project Climate Adaption Engineering for Extreme Events, in collaboration with the Sustainable Cities and Coasts Theme of the CSIRO Climate Adaption Flagship.

This paper aims to examine how they use transnational municipal networks (TMNs) as a tool for cooperation that supports marine governance in the context of climate change adaptation and mitigation. The analysis is carried out at two dimensions: spatial range (global or regional) and spatial identity (coastal or inland). Three case studies of TMNs are examined in detail: the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40); Connecting Delta Cities (CDC) and the Union of Baltic Cities (UBC). As research has shown, due to their organizational and normative limitations and a lack of maturity in ocean literacy, TMNs are not able to fully engage in all the activities related to climate change adaptation and mitigation as suggested by the UNEP. The TMNs implement both mitigation and adaptation measures, although 'soft' mitigation actions seem to be the most common. While the scale and innovativeness of a networks' operation are determined by their specificity resulting from their spatial identity, the effectiveness of jointly developed strategies and actions depend heavily on the allocation of human resources and the level of commitment of the involved cities toward becoming leaders.","[Dumala, Hanna] Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Inst Polit Sci & Adm, Dept Int Relat, Lublin, Poland; [Luszczuk, Michal] Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Inst Socioecon Geog & Spatial Management, Dept Social & Econ Geog, Lublin, Poland; [Piwowarczyk, Joanna; Zielinski, Tymon] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Sopot, Poland",Maria Curie-Sklodowska University; Maria Curie-Sklodowska University; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Dumala, H (corresponding author), Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Inst Polit Sci & Adm, Dept Int Relat, Lublin, Poland.",hanna.dumala@umcs.eu,"Luszczuk, Michal/O-8510-2015","Luszczuk, Michal/0000-0003-4655-2612; Zielinski, Tymon/0000-0003-4712-8899",,,,,110,1,1,2,10,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

We compare adaptation decisions under the increased frequency, severity, and tail thickness of extreme events as well as gradual changes.

Geographic distribution of CCA studies revealed that over 40% studies were carried out from central Nepal, while no study was conducted in ten districts of eastern and western Nepal. The study focus was also discrete, and the perception and attitude and impact assessment of climate change were common agendas; however, the drivers of change and options for adaptation were understudied.

Purpose: This article proposes a more appropriate basis for planning climate change adaptation. Anticipatory governance is a flexible decision framework that uses a wide range of possible futures to prepare for change and to guide current decisions toward maximizing future alternatives or minimizing future threats. Rather than trying to tame or ignore uncertainty, this approach explores uncertainty and its implications for current and future decision making. Methods: I review and summarize the literature on anticipatory governance and provide three case studies to demonstrate its application to climate change planning. Results and conclusions: Denver Water, New York City, and the City of Phoenix are all using scenarios to anticipate the range of global climate changes that may impact their communities and to develop adaptation strategies to address these impacts. Each is developing a decision framework for implementing adaptation strategies incrementally based on climate monitoring. An incremental approach minimizes the resources that must be allocated to address these risks and has allowed these cities to plan in spite of the high uncertainty associated with climate change science and social change. Takeaway for practice: The complexity, uncertainty, and distant planning horizon associated with climate change cannot be managed sufficiently for the traditional predict-and-plan approach to yield good decisions about the significant social and capital investments likely to be required for adaptation. To be successful, social institutions must embrace new methods that explore uncertainty and that provide strategic guidance for current and future decisions.

Linking Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) is essential for addressing these ever present, complex and increasing risks. Recent calls have been made to build these links in health. However, there is a need to clearly articulate why linking DRR and CCA is important in health. Furthermore, little is known about how DRR and CCA should be linked in health. By extensively examining relevant literature, this review presents the current state of knowledge of linking DRR and CCA in health. This includes the potential for maximising conceptual synergies such as building resilience, and reducing vulnerability and risk. Additionally, technical and operational synergies are identified to link DRR and CCA in health, including: policy, Early Warning Systems, vulnerability and risk assessment, health systems strengthening, infrastructure resilience, disaster preparedness and response, and health impact pathways. Public health actors have a central role in building these links due to their expertise, work functions, and experience in addressing complex health risks. The review concludes with recommendations for future research, including how to better link DRR and CCA in health; and the opportunities, challenges and enablers to build and sustain these links.","[Banwell, Nicola; Chu, Cordia] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Ctr Environm & Populat Hlth, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Rutherford, Shannon; Chu, Cordia] Griffith Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Environm & Populat Hlth, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Mackey, Brendan] Griffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Gold Coast City 4222, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University,"Banwell, N (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Ctr Environm & Populat Hlth, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",nicola.banwell@griffithuni.edu.au; s.rutherford@griffith.edu.au; b.mackey@griffith.edu.au; c.chu@griffith.edu.au,"Mackey, Brendan/ABE-3805-2020; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Banwell, Nicola/0000-0001-9983-7334; Mackey, Brendan/0000-0003-1996-4064; Chu, Cordia/0000-0002-3683-5638",Research Training Stipend Programme of the Australian Government Department of Education and Training; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; IJERPH,Research Training Stipend Programme of the Australian Government Department of Education and Training; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; IJERPH,"This article was published as the result of PhD research, for which financial support was provided through the Research Training Stipend Programme of the Australian Government Department of Education and Training, as well as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the form of an Endeavour Postgraduate Scholarship.

Little is known about how these policies of security, and the systems of resource provision they prioritise, affect householders' capacity to adapt to climate change. To better understand the connections between resource provision and consumption, this paper explores the notion that different 'energies' and 'waters' can be conceptualised as material elements of social practices, which shape the way practices are performed. We draw on a study of Australian migrants and their experiences with different resource provision systems in multiple countries, time periods and contexts across three generations. We discuss the differing characteristics of energy and water provision across three broad resource 'eras', and the way resources enable or reduce resourcefulness, adaptive capacity and resilience. We find that policy makers may inadvertently reduce householders' capacity to respond and adapt to climate change impacts by prioritising the resource characteristics of immateriality, abundance and homogeneity. We conclude that policy which prioritises the resource characteristics of materiality, diversity and scarcity is an important, underutilised and currently unacknowledged source of adaptive capacity.

The Case of the Alpine Regions,SUSTAINABILITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,South Tyrol; mountain; climate change; Alpine region; governance; climate; climatic adaptation,REGIME COMPLEX; URBAN GARDENS; MULTILEVEL; POLITICS; ENERGY; POWER; LAW,"Adaptation to climate change raises important governance issues in terms of governance structures and mechanisms, stakeholders' involvement, and links with the existing and wider-scale strategies. Notwithstanding the increasing attention at the global and European level, precise recommendations for the governance of climate change at the geographical macro-regional level are still lacking. Macro-regions span several states with some common morphological or climatic features and adopt wider-scale strategies which are not mandatory or do not take sufficient account of the specificities of any included regions. Each region is differently administered and adopts specific climate adaptation strategies for addressing just the challenges of the territories they govern, without considering the effects on the neighbouring ones. They also decentralize the climate policies towards the lowest levels of government, and this has increased the number of local bodies involved and promoted the participation of non-governmental players and citizens. Within the macro-regions, local climate conditions and their changes can be similar; however, their impacts can vary significantly at the individual territory level, and their effects can extend beyond traditional administrative boundaries. Dealing with these changes is particularly challenging in the Alpine area, which extends across 48 regions/autonomous provinces belonging to eight different European countries and is governed by three different international/transnational strategies. This territory represents a fragile ecosystem due to the current climate changes, which have influenced the climate conditions differently at the local level, as well as the richness of natural resources, and the opportunity to exploit them for economic reasons. South Tyrol (IT) is one of the autonomous provinces located in this area that is currently addressing the expected and unexpected impacts of climate change. Unlike other Italian Alpine regions, this region boasts a wider legislative autonomy, which enables the creation of more targeted climate adaptation policies and their decentralisation to the lowest level of administration, including the non-governmental players and citizens. As a result, the climate adaptation governance framework appears complex and hard to govern due to the plurality of actors and governmental levels at Alpine and regional/provincial levels. The present article sheds light on this framework, analysing specifically the three above-mentioned governance issues: governance structures, stakeholders' involvement mechanisms, and links with the existing wider-scales strategies. While discussing these topics, it then refers specifically to South Tyrol for the case study. Based on the documental analysis of the climate adaptation strategies and resultant findings, the preferred governance mechanism for addressing the specific climate adaptation challenges of Alpine regions would involve adopting some of the regulations included in regional mono-sectoral plans. These regulations do not relate to wider-scale strategies at the macro-regional level and refer just to the administered territories.

The main purpose of this paper is to determine the perceptions and experiences of climate change among coastal community residents in the Philippines. This study used a combination of methods, such as participatory mapping exercises, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and document analyses. The data, which were primarily collected from three coastal villages in the province of Bulacan, were subjected to a thematic network analysis. The findings revealed four dominant themes pertaining to climate change adaptation in a coastal community setting: vulnerability conditions, risk awareness, risk perceptions, and climate change awareness and perceptions. In particular, it was found out that the communities were exposed to the threats of natural hazards like flood and storm surge. Such exposure highlighted the residents' concerns over the risks of hazards on their livelihoods and properties. The residents also observed the unpredictability and the worsening effects of climate change. With their direct experiences of the natural hazards' impacts and awareness of the presence of risks, residents had undertaken actions to build their adaptive capacity. This study then highlights the value of integrating local knowledge into the mapping exercises, revealing crucial information regarding vulnerabilities, risks, and adaptation practices.","[Penalba, Ericson H.; Samaniego, Chaddlyn Rose C.] Bulacan State Univ, Educ Dept, Meneses Campus, Bulacan, Philippines; [David, Albert Patrick J.; Mabanta, Michael John D.; Ellamil, Sheryl D.

Responses to such impacts are being framed and addressed by strategies and policies under the climate change adaptation and mitigation frameworks. However, approaching resilience and adaptive capacities are ever more in need in complex neighborhoods, especially when these are facing climate impacts such as flooding. Framing social dimensions into that adaptive capacity in complex urban systems characterized by poverty, exclusion and the poor public services access makes harder their living standards. Thereby, frameworks taking into account social elements and key indicators of inclusiveness, contribute to the understanding of the social fabrics based on the living conditions of disadvantaged localities. This special issue explores resilience in the wake of climate-related events such as flooding in neighborhoods with striking social, economic and environmental conditions. Studying the case of the flood-suffering neighborhood of Fredonia in Cartagena, Colombia, will shed light on this particular issue by providing relevant evidence that the levels of climate impacts and hazards occurring in vulnerable urban areas in developing countries, rely on particular social traits that ultimately undermine adaptation efforts for resilience, hence becoming a social problem.","[Luna-Galvan, Mauricio] Univ Tecnol Bolivar, Int Relat, Turbaco, Bolivar, Colombia; [Vargas-Chaves, Ivan] Univ Tecnol Bolivar, Turbaco, Bolivar, Colombia",Universidad Tecnologica de Bolivar; Universidad Tecnologica de Bolivar,"Luna-Galvan, M (corresponding author), Univ Tecnol Bolivar, Int Relat, Turbaco, Bolivar, Colombia.",,"Vargas-Chaves, Iván/AGE-5173-2022","Vargas-Chaves, Iván/0000-0001-6597-2335; Luna Galvan, Mauricio/0000-0002-4594-4940",,,,,27,0,0,3,7,EUROPEAN CENTER SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,ROME,"VIA DEI FIORI 34, ROME, 00172, ITALY",2239-5938,2239-6101,,EUR J SUSTAIN DEV,Eur.

This study assessed adaptation priority differences in the Philippines to determine if traditional climate change decision makers accurately represent the marginalized communities they serve. Specifically, this study gathered baseline data of climate change knowledge, compared resiliency priorities and proposed strategies between local government workers and village residents, and analyzed factors that contribute to identify differences. The study's target group (residents of small villages) has historically been marginalized in municipal environmental decision making. Data collected through focus group discussions and interviews demonstrated there was a statistical difference between local government officials who were more likely to propose abstract, systemic adaptation strategies to build social capacity (69% of government officials' proposed strategies), while village residents focused on physical infrastructure (59% of village residents' proposed strategies). A second study outcome was the identification of contributing factors in how Filipinos might propose climate change adaptation strategies: for example, education levels, social or economic class, accessibility to resources, sources of information, and past experience with hazards. The significance of this research is the evidence of climate change adaptation prioritization differences between the country's traditional decision-making group, the municipal government unit, and marginalized members of local villages. The differences show that local municipal government units in the Philippines may not be the most effective base group for bottom-up adaptation and support the need for effective collaboration and community engagement in future climate change planning.","[Nabong, Emily C.; Arias, Mauricio E.; Mihelcic, James R.] Univ S Florida, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 4202 E Fowler Ave,ENG 030, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Whiteford, Linda M.] Univ S Florida, Dept Anthropol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Nabong, EC (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 4202 E Fowler Ave,ENG 030, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",enabong@usf.edu,"Arias, Mauricio/H-5667-2013","Arias, Mauricio/0000-0002-8805-6353; Nabong, Emily/0000-0002-5317-2995",National Science Foundation [1930451],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1930451.,,51,1,1,2,18,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1092-8758,1557-9018,,ENVIRON ENG SCI,Environ.

Drawing on interviews with key local stakeholders, this article investigates study visits organized by European municipal climate networks. The results of this exploratory research show that study visits about adaptation policies can (1) particularly stimulate conceptual learning, (2) increase the credibility of policies within municipal administrations, (3) be used as strategic instruments by mentor cities, (4) be more successful if the peer-cities are not too different (in terms of size, institutional context), and (5) under certain conditions, lead to policy adoption in a learning city. Future research needs to critically discuss the mass suitability of learning from frontrunner cities. Furthermore, a call is raised for more research and practical action on how to initiate and improve learning exchanges beyond the strict division between mentors and learners. Instead, the focus needs to be on mutual learning exchanges.","[Haupt, Wolfgang] Leibniz Inst Res Soc & Space, Flakenstr 29-31, D-15537 Erkner, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Raumbezogene Sozialforschung (IRS),"Haupt, W (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Res Soc & Space, Flakenstr 29-31, D-15537 Erkner, Germany.",wolfgang.haupt@leibniz-irs.de,,"Haupt, Wolfgang/0000-0002-1042-2106",,,,,44,7,7,2,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1078-0874,1552-8332,,URBAN AFF REV,Urban Aff.

It argues that the formal climate change response framework has failed to incorporate local institutions as critical components of adaptation strategies, even though local institutions and people have age-old niches and decades of experience in confronting adverse weather events. The findings indicate that these communities have over the years developed critical norms around ensuring agricultural production and stemming the impacts of adverse climatic conditions without government support. The study underpins the resilience of these institutions in climate change adaptation and finds that, despite long bouts with gully erosion and flooding, these communities have over time developed practices and roles that ensure survival. Thus, these communities possess bastions of creativity and experience that may be useful in formal adaptation and resilience strategies to climate change in Nigeria.","[Anugwom, Edlyne E.

Pollution reduction, increased human wellbeing and climate change adaptation are only some of the challenges targeted by NBSs. However, under the warming climate affecting many of the world's cities, most of modern NBSs will be highly impacted by the same climate factors they hope to mitigate. As in the case of extreme temperatures or altered water availability, these factors can impact and cause the failure in the organisms, technical elements and governance structures that NBSs rely upon, thus decreasing performance, reliability and sustainability of these solutions. In this commentary we propose critical considerations related to designing, building and managing climateready NBSs-defined as local integrated solutions able to cope with or adapt to climate change. We do so by highlighting examples in heat- and drought-stricken areas across Australian cities as they sit at the global forefront of a hotter world. We discuss in detail i) tolerance and adaptability of NBS to new climates, ii) NBS design for weather extremes and climate-safety margins, iii) NBS trialing and prototyping, and iv) planning for climate-ready NBSs. In doing so, we highlight caveats and limitations to propose an implementation framework to make NBSs not only work, but succeed, in a hotter urban world; one that sees 50 degrees C as a critical limit to sustain urban life and nature.","[Ossola, Alessandro] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Ossola, Alessandro] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Burnley, Vic, Australia; [Ossola, Alessandro] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Lin, Brenda B.] CSIRO Land & Water, Dutton Pk, Qld 4102, Australia",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Melbourne; Macquarie University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Ossola, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;Ossola, A (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Burnley, Vic, Australia.;Ossola, A (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",aossola@ucdavis.edu; brenda.lin@csiro.au,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Ossola, Alessandro/D-1262-2012","Ossola, Alessandro/0000-0002-0507-6026; Lin, Brenda/0000-0002-6011-9172",,,,,73,10,10,8,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

This article explores Filipinos knowledge and perception of climate change and their association with what action Filipinos take to prepare for rapid onset natural hazards such as typhoons. Data for this study were collected from a nationally representative random survey of 5,184 adults conducted between March and April of 2017. Filipinos self-report relatively low levels of knowledge of climate change and cited increased temperatures, shifts in seasons, and heavier rains as the most likely consequences. Levels of disaster preparedness in the Philippines differ widely by region. Although most Filipinos perceive that natural hazards are a risk to them, only a third of Filipinos undertake measures to prepare for disasters. Filipinos who perceive climate-related changes directly impacting their households report taking greater action to prepare for disasters. Filipinos who believe they have been directly impacted by climate-related changes are also more likely to prepare for disasters, take planning actions, and undertake material actions to prepare, such as dwelling improvements. Other factors associated with disaster preparedness include gender, membership in an association, wealth, risk perception, and prior exposure to and losses due to disasters. The findings imply that, while posing different challenges and requiring different responses, adaptation to climate change and disaster preparedness are inherently associated and potentially mutually reinforcing. Policies and programs would arguably benefit from a more unified intervention framework that links climate change adaptation and disaster preparedness.","[Bollettino, Vincenzo; Alcayna-Stevens, Tilly; Sharma, Manasi; Pham, Phuong; Vinck, Patrick] Harvard Univ, Harvard Humanitarian Initiat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Dy, Philip] Harvard Univ, Harvard Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Harvard University,"Bollettino, V (corresponding author), 14 Story St,2nd Floor, Cambridge, MA 02318 USA.",vbollett@hsph.harvard.edu,,"Alcayna, Tilly/0000-0003-1237-1039; Pham, Phuong/0000-0002-5696-2933",,,,,29,26,26,5,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

Under a rapidly changing climate, it is more important than ever to estimate the degree of future water security. This is a challenging task as it depends on many different variables: the degree of warming and its consequent effects on hydrological resources, the water demand by different sectors, and the possible ameliorations or deteriorations of the effects due to climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. A simple and transparent conceptual framework has been developed to assess the European vulnerability to freshwater stress under the present hydro-climatic and socioeconomic conditions, in comparison to projections of future vulnerability for different degrees of global warming (1.5 degrees C, 2 degrees C and 4 degrees C), under the high-rate warming scenario (RCP8.5). Different levels of adaptation to climate change are considered in the framework, by employing various relevant pathways of socioeconomic development. A spatially detailed pan-European map of vulnerability to freshwater shortage has been developed at the local administrative level, making this approach extremely useful for supporting regional level policymaking and implementation and strategic planning against future freshwater stress.

Our analysis is based on recent household survey data with detailed household plot-level information about adaptation strategies, plot ownership, farm management decisions, and the right to control outputs from the plots among spouses within the household. The observed patterns of women's ownership, management and economic rights of land suggest that all are important aspects of women's bargaining power.

There are a wide range of areas in mitigation of and adaptation to climate change that need substantial investment. Major areas and successful cases mitigation of and adaptation to climate change in agriculture that have worked in developing countries are examined. A list of areas that have worked, could work and be scaled up or transferred is identified and discussed. This study concludes that mainstreaming agricultural mitigation and adaptation into agricultural development programs, enhancing local capacity, and considering different stakeholders' needs are major experiences for successfully financing sustainable agriculture under climate change.","[Huang Ji-kun; Wang Yang-jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wang Yang-jie] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Huang, JK (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",jkhuang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2012CB955700]; World Institute for Development Economics Research of United Nations University (UNU-WIDER); International Development Research Center [107093-001],National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(National Basic Research Program of China); World Institute for Development Economics Research of United Nations University (UNU-WIDER); International Development Research Center,"The authors acknowledge the financial support of the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program, 2012CB955700), the World Institute for Development Economics Research of United Nations University (UNU-WIDER), and the International Development Research Center (107093-001).",,61,18,18,36,154,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2095-3119,,,J INTEGR AGR,J.

Two common explanations for adaptation gaps are (1) private parties failing to recognize that the climate is changing and (2) the cost of adaptation is higher than commonly believed. This paper shows how these two explanations are linked and that the likelihood and duration of adaptation gaps depend on whether climate change is characterized by stationary or non-stationary dynamics. Using an investment in water-saving irrigation in California's Central Valley as an illustrative example, we find little evidence that failing to account for climate change would explain adaptation gaps. A more likely explanation for adaptation gaps is a failure to account for the adaptation option value that arises due to the possibility of maladaptation.","[Sims, Charles] Univ Tennessee, Howard H Baker Jr Ctr Publ Policy, 1640 Cumberland Ave, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Sims, Charles] Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, 1640 Cumberland Ave, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Null, Sarah E.] Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, 5210 Old Main Hill,NR 210, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Medellin-Azuara, Josue] Univ Calif Merced, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Merced, CA USA; [Odame, Augustina] European Univ Inst, Sch Transnat Governance, Fiesole, Italy",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University of California System; University of California Merced; European University Institute,"Sims, C (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Howard H Baker Jr Ctr Publ Policy, 1640 Cumberland Ave, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.;Sims, C (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, 1640 Cumberland Ave, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",cbsims@utk.edu; sarah.null@usu.edu; jmedellin-azuara@ucmerced.edu; augustinayaaoye.odame@eui.eu,"Null, Sarah/E-4422-2011","Null, Sarah/0000-0001-7451-7908",,,,,71,1,1,2,3,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

J,"Joye, JF",,,,"Joye, Jean-Francois",,,Tourism development and adaptation to climate change through legal constraint,WORLDWIDE HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM THEMES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Tourism development; Climate change; Urban planning; Ski resorts,,"Purpose - This paper aims to present a legal study addressing the way in which tourism development and planning in mountain areas can be adapted to climate change issues. It gives examples of attempts to regulate such development by law. Recent legislation in France has created new obligations targeted at ski resort managers. Urban planning and tourism development are key topics of the new French Mountain Act (law of 28 December 2016). The law moves back and forth between two goals, economic development and the protection of nature, and it is sometimes difficult to understand the general coherence of the text. Nevertheless, two significant new legal elements can be highlighted. Planning policies in mountain areas have to take climate change issues into account in the process of authorising major tourism building projects. Moreover, for the first time, the law requires obsolete ski lifts to be dismantled when they are no longer in use. Of course, although these measures are only legally theoretical at the moment, they represent important progress and are initially relevant to many ski resorts affected by global warming, especially in low-altitude mountain areas. Many of these are already experiencing a lack of snow, and a new economic model needs to be drawn up. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based on a review of French laws having an effect on mountain areas' adaptation to climate change. Findings - This paper presents two innovations included in the new French Mountain Act (law of 28 December 2016). Originality/value - This paper underscores problems emanating from global warming in mountain areas. Some ski resorts are facing a lack of snow. The main issue is to anticipate the fact that many ski lifts, or other structures or buildings created for the snow economy, could become obsolete. Legal tools can provide a solution by forcing administrations or operators to be cautious when making decisions relating to new tourist investments, and to dismantle obsolete ski lifts.","[Joye, Jean-Francois] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Fac Law, Jacob Bellecombette Campus, Chambery, France",,"Joye, JF (corresponding author), Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Fac Law, Jacob Bellecombette Campus, Chambery, France.",jean-francois.joye@univ-smb.fr,,,,,,,15,5,7,1,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1755-4217,1755-4225,,WORLDW HOSP TOUR THE,Worldw.

This gender discrimination makes them more vulnerable to a variety of threats. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the behaviour of female rice farmers in Mazandaran Province, in northern Iran, toward climate change adaptation using protection motivation theory (PMT). 173 female heads of households' rice farmers in Mazandaran Province were selected through stratified random sampling. According to the findings, the perceived vulnerability (beta = 0.19), perceived severity (beta = 0.33), self-efficacy (beta = 0.4), and response effectiveness (beta = 0.35) of female rice farmers have a positive and noticeable effect on responding behaviour to climate change. However, the response costs (beta = -0.61) have a negative but noticeable effect on their adaptation behaviour toward changing climate. Research findings also show that climate change severely damages the physical capital of women paddy farmers. The damage caused by these climate crises has a greater impact on the production capacity, product quality, production costs and food security of female heads of households. The findings of this study will help define patterns determining the adaptation of women to climate change, and public and private sector's strategic planning and action.","[Goli, Imaneh; Abadi, Maryam Omidi Najaf; Lashgarara, Farhad] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Econ Agr Extens & Educ, Tehran, Iran; [Tanaskovik, Vjekoslav; Chukaliev, Ordan] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ Skopje, Fac Agr Sci & Food Skopje, Skopje, North Macedonia; [Viira, Ants-Hannes] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, Chair Rural Econ, Tartu, Estonia; [Pour, Mahdad; Azadi, Hossein] Univ Liege, Dept Econ & Rural Dev, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Gembloux, Belgium; [Sklenicka, Petr; Janeckova, Kristina; Azadi, Hossein] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Azadi, Hossein] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Ghent, Belgium",Islamic Azad University; Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje; Estonian University of Life Sciences; University of Liege; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Ghent University,"Azadi, H (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Ghent, Belgium.;Abadi, MON (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Econ Agr Extens & Educ, Tehran Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran.",omidi@srbiau.ac.ir; hossein.azadi@ugent.be,"Omidi Najafabadi, Maryam/AAU-1669-2021; Azadi, Hossein/E-2361-2011; Sklenicka, Petr/B-9774-2012","Omidi Najafabadi, Maryam/0000-0003-1830-7660; Azadi, Hossein/0000-0002-5108-1993; Sklenicka, Petr/0000-0001-9778-9674",,,,,102,0,0,11,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

However, the usefulness of the cycle has become questionable in diverse urban settings. Thus, this research uses a pragmatic approach to identify challenges in the effectiveness of the conventional disaster risk management cycle and its phases in the context of urban flooding in Pakistan. Institutions involved in flood risk management were interviewed using semistructured questionnaires. Three focus group discussions were also held to understand the viewpoints of selected communities. Thematic analysis was used to categorize views and responses under each phase. The analysis reveals that, despite the advent of disaster risk reduction strategies, local institutions are still relying on reactive approaches and are managing flood risk on an ad-hoc basis. Weak governance and limited corrective measures for existing development patterns are making it difficult to manage flood risks. There is an urgent need to perform multihazard vulnerability and risk assessment, and develop specific strategies under the philosophies of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. This study recommends the inclusion of climate change adaptation and resilience in the current management cycle for reducing future urban risks.","[Rana, Irfan Ahmad] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, H-12 Sect, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Asim, Muhammad; Aslam, Atif Bilal] Univ Engn & Technol UET, Dept City & Reg Planning, Lahore, Pakistan; [Jamshed, Ali] Inst Spatial & Reg Planning IREUS, Stuttgart, Germany",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan,"Rana, IA (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, H-12 Sect, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.",iarana@nit.nust.edu.pk; muhammad.asim@uet.edu.pk; atif.aslam@uet.edu.pk; ali.jamshed@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de,"Rana, Irfan Ahmad/C-2560-2017","Rana, Irfan Ahmad/0000-0002-3157-1186; Jamshed, Ali/0000-0003-4802-1225",,,,,96,19,19,11,31,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0955,,,URBAN CLIM,Urban CLim.,JUL,2021,38,,,,,,,,100893,10.1016/j.uclim.2021.100893,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2021.100893,,JUN 2021,12,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,TS0HZ,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000679338800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The building industry is taking various actions to achieve sustainable development, implement energy conservation strategies, and provide climate change mitigation. In addition to mitigation, it is crucial to adapt to climate change, and to investigate the possible risks and limitations of mitigation strategies. Although the importance of climate change adaptation is well-understood, there are still challenges in understanding and modeling the impacts of climate change, and the consequent risks and extremes. This work provides a comprehensive study of the impacts of climate change on the energy performances and thermal comfort of European residential building stocks. To perform an unbiased assessment and account for climate uncertainties and extreme events, a large set of future climate data was used for a 90-year period (2010-2099). Climate data for 38 European cities in five different climate zones, downscaled by the RCA4 regional climate model, were synthesized and applied to simulate the respective energy performances of the residential building stocks in the cities. The results suggest that there will be larger needs for cooling buildings in the future and less heating demand; however, there are differences in the variation rates between zones and cities. Discomfort hours will increase notably in cities within cooling-dominated zones, but will not be affected considerably in cities within heating-dominated zones. In addition to long-term changes, climate-induced extremes can considerably affect future energy demands, especially the cooling demand; this may become challenging for both buildings and energy systems.","[Yang, Yuchen; Nik, Vahid M.] Lund Univ, Div Bldg Phys, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, SE-22363 Lund, Sweden; [Javanroodi, Kavan; Nik, Vahid M.] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Div Bldg Technol, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Javanroodi, Kavan] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Solar Energy & Bldg Phys Lab LESO PB, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",Lund University; Chalmers University of Technology; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Nik, VM (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Div Bldg Phys, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, SE-22363 Lund, Sweden.",vahid.nik@byggtek.lth.se,"Javanroodi, Kavan/ABF-5290-2021; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Yang, Yuchen/GZK-6062-2022","Javanroodi, Kavan/0000-0002-4989-9681; ","joint programming initiative 'ERA-Net Smart Energy Systems' focus initiative on Integrated, Regional Energy Systems; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [775970, 101033683]","joint programming initiative 'ERA-Net Smart Energy Systems' focus initiative on Integrated, Regional Energy Systems; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme","This work was partly supported by the joint programming initiative 'ERA-Net Smart Energy Systems' focus initiative on Integrated, Regional Energy Systems, with support from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [775970] and the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement for the COLLECTiEF (Collective Intelligence for Energy Flexibility) project (grant agreement ID: 101033683).",,103,31,31,5,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-2619,1872-9118,,APPL ENERG,Appl.

The objectives of this study were to determine the potential impact of climate change on sorghum yield for rainfed production systems and to evaluate the potential of irrigation and shifting planting dates as adaptation options for two major sorghum production regions in Ethiopia. The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) Cropping System Model (CSM)-CERES-Sorghum model was used to simulate the impact of climate change on sorghum yield for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs; RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) and for three future periods including the 2025s (2010-2039), 2055s (2040-2069), and 2085s (2070-2099). The Agricultural Model Improvement and Inter-comparison Project (AgMIP) framework was used to select five representative GCMs for hot/dry, cool/dry, middle, hot/wet, and cool/wet climate scenarios. Two climate change adaptation practices including supplemental irrigation at two levels (deficit and full) to the current rainfed production system and shifting planting dates were evaluated. The CSM-CERES-Sorghum model was calibrated and evaluated using eight years of experimental data from Meisso, eastern Ethiopia. The model was then run for Kobo and Meisso under different climate change and crop management scenarios. Based on model evaluation results, the model performed well for simulating sorghum yield (R-2 = 0.99), anthesis (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 1.3), and maturity (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE = 4.4). The results showed that the average temperature for Kobo and Meisso is expected to increase by up to 6.C under RCP8.5 in 2085. For the rainfed production systems without adaptation practices, drought stress is projected to intensify during anthesis, which was reflected by projected yield reductions by up 2 t ha(-1) for the two sites. Full irrigation was effective in reducing moisture stress and, thereby, increasing sorghum yield by up to 3 t ha(-1) for Kobo and 2 t ha(-1) for Meisso. On average, full irrigation resulted in a 1 t ha(-1) yield increase compared with deficit irrigation. Early planting dates also resulted in an increase in yield compared to the baseline planting dates, especially when combined with supplemental irrigation, although late planting was consistently disadvantageous even with supplemental irrigation. This study highlighted that the CSM-CERES-Sorghum model can be effectively used to simulate climate change effects on sorghum yield and evaluate different climate change adaptation practices. The outcomes of this study can also help to implement management decisions towards climate change adaptation for the current subsistence and fragile rainfed crop production system in Ethiopia and similar ecoregions across the globe.","[Getachew, Fikadu; Bayabil, Haimanote K.; Teshome, Fitsum T.] Univ Florida, IFAS, Ctr Trop Res & Educ, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Homestead, FL 33031 USA; [Hoogenboom, Gerrit] Univ Florida, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Gainesville, FL USA; [Hoogenboom, Gerrit] Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Syst, Gainesville, FL USA; [Zewdu, Eshetu] Ethiopian Inst Agr Res, Climate & Geospatial Res Dept, Melkassa, Ethiopia",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR),"Bayabil, HK (corresponding author), Univ Florida, IFAS, Ctr Trop Res & Educ, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Homestead, FL 33031 USA.",hbayabil@ufl.edu,"Hoogenboom, Gerrit/F-3946-2010; Teshome, Fitsum Tilahun/AAE-7202-2022","Hoogenboom, Gerrit/0000-0002-1555-0537; Teshome, Fitsum Tilahun/0000-0002-6900-307X","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture [FLA-TRC-005751]; University of Florida, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences [212-2100-00129077]","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); University of Florida, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences(University of Florida)","This material is based upon work that is supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, under the Hatch Project No. FLA-TRC-005751.

Regional adaptation projects in the Netherlands form prominent examples of this. However, there is a lack of systematic empirical studies on how JKP can be done successfully. Here, we take the next step toward generating design principles for JKP. We do so by carrying out a comparative analysis of six Dutch adaptation projects using a previously developed assessment framework. Project documents were studied, and 30 semi-structured interviews were held with researchers, policy-makers, and financiers in the projects. Based on project comparisons, we derive and elaborate on two design principles for JKP. First, the most successful projects managed to create what we term a protected space for knowledge development while establishing connections with ongoing policy processes. Successful JKP seems to be more likely in cases in which actors make a conscious decision for the institutional location of the project on the research-policy nexus, whereby the coordinating entity has some characteristics of a boundary organization. Second, specific resources, including facilities, boundary objects, and specific competencies increase the chance for success.","[Hegger, Dries; Dieperink, Carel] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Hegger, D (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",,"Hegger, Dries/S-8727-2016","Hegger, Dries/0000-0003-2721-3527; Dieperink, Carel/0000-0002-1926-4642",Dutch National Partnership for Sustainable Earth Research,Dutch National Partnership for Sustainable Earth Research,"This paper was prepared with the support of the Dutch National Partnership for Sustainable Earth Research.

Adaptation to climate change is an important research topic, especially in agriculture, a sector reliant on climate-sensitive resources. Several studies have examined the adaptation issues and identified factors that influence the adaptive responses of farmers in specific contexts or regions. However, little research effort has been paid to collecting and categorizing those factors. Whilst a number of demographic, socio-economic, technological, cultural and psychological factors, and resources have been reported, the use of social, cultural and psychological factors remains relatively limited. The review provides useful knowledge for future research on factors affecting farmers? adaptation to climate change. It highlights the importance of a series of factors, including both socio-economic and psychological considerations, in explaining farmers? adaptive responses. It is also a relevant reference for planning effective adaptation strategies in the agricultural sector.","[Hoa Le Dang] Nong Lam Univ, Fac Econ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Hoa Le Dang; Nuberg, Ian] Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Waite Campus, Urrbrae, SA 5064, Australia; [Li, Elton] Knowledge Exchange Australia, Aberfoyle Pk, SA, Australia; [Bruwer, Johan] Univ South Australia, Sch Mkt, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Bruwer, Johan] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Psychol, Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia",Nong Lam University; University of Adelaide; University of South Australia; Charles Sturt University,"Dang, HL (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Waite Campus, Urrbrae, SA 5064, Australia.;Dang, HL (corresponding author), Nong Lam Univ, Fac Econ, Linh Trung Ward, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",danglehoa@hcmuaf.edu.vn,"Bruwer, Johan/L-1280-2013","Bruwer, Johan/0000-0001-7568-605X; Nuberg, Ian/0000-0003-1942-1190; Dang, Hoa Le/0000-0002-5943-9515",,,,,88,42,44,10,47,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Climate change and extreme weather events have caused Ethiopia's agricultural production to decline and exacerbated food insecurity over the last few decades. This study investigates whether farmers' awareness and perceptions of climate change play a role in climate change adaptation using climate-smart agricultural practices. To collect data, 385 households in Southern Ethiopia were sampled using a multistage sampling. A Heckman probit two-stage selection model was applied to investigate the factors influencing farmers' perceptions to climate change and adaptation measures through adoption of climate-smart agriculture practices, complemented with key informant interviews and focused group discussions. The results indicated that most farmers (81.80%) perceived that the local climate is changing, with 71.9% reporting increased temperature and 53.15% reporting decreasing rainfall distribution. Therefore, farmers attempted to apply some adaptation practices, including soil and water conservation with biological measures, improved crop varieties, agroforestry, improved breeds, cut and carry system, controlled grazing, and residue incorporation. The empirical results revealed that farmers adaptation to climate change through adoptions of CSA practices was significantly influenced by education, family size, gender, landholding size, farming experience, access to climate information, training received, social membership, livestock ownership, farm income and extension services. The study found that farmers' perceptions of climate change and variability were significantly influenced by their age, level of education, farming experience, and access to climate information, hence, the need to focus on enhancing the accuracy of weather information, strengthening extension services, and considering a gender-sensitive adaptation approach toward improving farmers' knowledge and aspirations. Agricultural policies should support the efforts of farmers to increase the reliance on climate risk and alleviate farmers' difficulties in adopting climate-smart agriculture practices.","[Belay, Abrham; Mirzabaev, Alisher] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Genscherallee 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Belay, Abrham; Oludhe, Christopher; Olaka, Lydia A.] Univ Nairobi, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Earth & Climate Sci, POB 30197-00100,GPO, Nairobi, Kenya; [Berhane, Zerihun] Addis Ababa Univ, Ctr African & Asian Studies, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Belay, Abrham; Osano, Philip M.] World Agroforestry Ctr, Stockholm Environm Inst Africa, POB 30677, Nairobi, Kenya; [Recha, John W.; Demissie, Teferi; Solomon, Dawit] Int Livestock Res Inst ILRI, POB 30709-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Olaka, Lydia A.] Tech Univ Kenya, Sch Phys & Environm, Dept Geosci & Environm, POB 52428-00200, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Bonn; University of Nairobi; Addis Ababa University; CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF); CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Technical University of Kenya,"Belay, A (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Genscherallee 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.;Belay, A (corresponding author), Univ Nairobi, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Earth & Climate Sci, POB 30197-00100,GPO, Nairobi, Kenya.;Belay, A (corresponding author), World Agroforestry Ctr, Stockholm Environm Inst Africa, POB 30677, Nairobi, Kenya.",abrish.z2010@gmail.com,,"Recha, John/0000-0002-1146-7197; Solomon, Dawit/0000-0002-6839-6801; Weldegebriel, Zerihun Berhane/0000-0002-1259-274X",World Bank Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) ESA regional project [D7540]; Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA); Deutscher Academischer Austaushdenist (DAAD); Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia (MKW) under the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments; AGNES-BAYER Sciences Foundation; Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia (MKW) under the Excellence Strategy of the Federal Government; Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia (MKW) under the Excellence Strategy of the State Government,World Bank Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) ESA regional project; Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA); Deutscher Academischer Austaushdenist (DAAD); Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia (MKW) under the Excellence Strategy of the Federal and State Governments; AGNES-BAYER Sciences Foundation; Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia (MKW) under the Excellence Strategy of the Federal Government; Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia (MKW) under the Excellence Strategy of the State Government,"This research was financially supported through a grant from the World Bank Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) ESA regional project (Grant No. D7540) signed between Alliance-Bioversity-CIAT and the International Development Association (IDA).

However, there are several constraints to the sector's development, including negative impacts of climate change. To mitigate these impacts, farmers implement a range of technical strategies. The extent of farmer's awareness and perceptions of climate change impacts influences these strategies and hence farmers' level of adaptation. This study was undertaken to assess farmers' awareness and perceptions of climate change impacts in Aguie Department, Niger Republic. Descriptive statistics and a regression model were used for data analysis. The results from a descriptive analysis show that the majority of respondents (84.4%) were aware of climate risks, but had differing perceptions of climate change impacts on production and annual revenue. A regression test revealed that climate-related information is highly significant in determining farmers' awareness of climate change impacts. Most of the respondents reported negative impacts from climate change, and the majority, therefore, adjusted their farming system, albeit at different levels. A probit analysis shows that awareness, perception, education, crop production, soil fertility and annual revenue are highly influential on farmers' climate change impacts adaptation. This research highlights farmer awareness and perceptions as key factors in the climate change impacts adaptation debate. The findings reveal that effective adaptation to climate change impacts is highly dependent on the extent of community awareness and how farmers perceive the impacts of climate change. The study highlights that institutions targeting households' livelihood improvement and making decisions concerning climate change adaptation need to focus on media outreach in local languages, improving locally adapted extension services, and developing water use efficiency measures such as improved irrigation for effective and long-term adaptation.","[Ado, Abdou Matsalabi; Bo, Li; Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad] China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev Studies, 2 Yuan Ming Yuan West Rd, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Leshan, Jin] China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev, CEPRC, 2 Yuan Ming Yuan West Rd, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Savadogo, Patrice] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Africa Reg Off Sahel Node, BP E5118, Bamako, Mali",China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University,"Leshan, J (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev, CEPRC, 2 Yuan Ming Yuan West Rd, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",jinls@cau.edu.cn,"Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad/AAT-7073-2021; Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad/J-2476-2019","Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad/0000-0001-9142-2441","College of Humanities and Development studies (COHD) at China Agricultural University, Beijing, China; Dryland Development Programme (Drydev); European Union Land Restoration Project","College of Humanities and Development studies (COHD) at China Agricultural University, Beijing, China; Dryland Development Programme (Drydev); European Union Land Restoration Project","This study, part of Ph.D. study, is supported by College of Humanities and Development studies (COHD) at China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.

However, social psychology and behavioural research suggest that there is a wide variety of approaches that individuals use to make such choices. We explore this heterogeneity against the backdrop of so-called dual process models', analysing participants' responses in a survey of public beliefs about and preferences for climate change adaptation policies. We find that the postulate of two different types of decision-making, the systematic-analytical and the heuristic-holistic, does indeed help us to understand patterns in respondent behaviour that are, in turn, underpinned by respondents' motivation and ability to process information. Participants who were motivated and able to process the information provided were more likely to express preferences in line with their beliefs about adaptation policies, whereas those less motivated and more confused were more likely to use generalised rules-of-thumb that were not specific to the policy issue at hand. Depending on the theoretical framework of a study, such heterogeneity in response consistency and use of generic rules-of-thumb might have implications for the usefulness of survey outcomes. We discuss the implications of our findings, and draw conclusions for survey-based environmental research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Another daunting task - adapting to water-related impacts of climate change, is also challenging China's water managers. These challenges have been posing threats to China's economic, social and environmental development. While separate efforts in promoting IWRM and climate change adaptation have been made, the approach of mainstreaming climate change adaptation strategy within IWRM is seldom studied. Attempting to fill the gap, this paper argues that there is great potential in synergizing them after analysing their distinctions and common points. By developing climate-proofing strategies within IWRM, mainstreaming is able to minimize adverse water-related climate change risks and maximize the benefits of policies and plans. In this study, entry points of mainstreaming climate change adaptation in the sustaining environment of IWRM and its process will be identified and analysed.","Univ Western Sydney, Sch Law, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia",Western Sydney University,"He, XB (corresponding author), Univ Western Sydney, Sch Law, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia.",cedar1985@gmail.com,,,,,,,98,8,8,1,28,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",1366-7017,1996-9759,,WATER POLICY,Water Policy,,2013,15,6,,,,,895,921,,10.2166/wp.2013.084,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wp.2013.084,,,27,Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Water Resources,262WH,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000327768100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Disaster risk reduction (DRR) should be integrated as priority in the agendas of local authorities and it is important that scientists help bring to the attention of decision-makers the science-based solutions that can be employed before a disaster happens. Supporting generation of evidence-based data and facilitating research activities that contribute to existing knowledge on climate, risks and disasters is embedded in the vision and mission of the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) and the network has been supporting research and capacity development activities through its Climate Adaptation Framework (CAF) and under the thematic area of Risk Reduction and Resilience (RRR) that encompasses climate change adaptation (CCA) and DRR. This study revisited and assessed a variety of disaster risks addressed in regional projects and characterized the type of DRR and CCA measures proposed and/or utilized. Informed by project implementation experiences of 24 expert practitioners, the study examined the conceptual understanding of DRR and CCA and explored the potential contribution of the project outcomes to the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) and its linkage with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The results present regional characteristics of risks, DRR-CCA measures and approaches, and lessons learned on integrating and mainstreaming DRR and CCA within and across sectors relevant to the SFDRR Target E on increasing national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020.","[Uchiyama, Christmas; Ismail, Nafesa; Stevenson, Linda Anne] Asia Pacific Network Global Change Res, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan",,"Uchiyama, C (corresponding author), Asia Pacific Network Global Change Res, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.",cuchiyama@apn-gcr.org,,"Uchiyama, Christmas/0000-0002-0803-3291; Ismail, Nafesa/0000-0002-6587-0686",,,,,47,3,3,2,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2590-0617,,,PROG DISASTER SCI,Prog.

Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) pose risks to exposed and vulnerable populations and can be linked in part to long-term post-Little Ice Age climate change because precariously dammed glacial lakes sometimes formed as glaciers generally retreated after the mid-1800s. This paper provides an interdisciplinary and historical analysis of 40 years of glacier hazard management on Mount Hualcan, at glacial Lake 513, and in the city of Carhuaz in Peru's Cordillera Blanca mountain range. The case study examines attempted hazard zoning, glacial lake evolution and monitoring, and emergency engineering projects to drain Lake 513. It also analyzes the 11 April 2010 Hualcan rock-ice avalanche that triggered a Lake 513 GLOF; we offer both a scientific assessment of the possible role of temperature on slope stability and a GIS spatial analysis of human impacts. Qualitative historical analysis of glacier hazard management since 1970 allows us to identify and explain why certain actions and policies to reduce risk were implemented or omitted. We extrapolate these case-specific variables to generate a broader socio-environmental framework identifying factors that can facilitate or impede disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. Facilitating factors are technical capacity, disaster events with visible hazards, institutional support, committed individuals, and international involvement. Impediments include divergent risk perceptions, imposed government policies, institutional instability, knowledge disparities, and invisible hazards. This framework emerges from an empirical analysis of a coupled social-ecological system and offers a holistic approach for integrating disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation.","[Carey, Mark] Univ Oregon, Robert D Clark Honors Coll, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Huggel, Christian; Haeberli, Wilfried] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Bury, Jeffrey] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Portocarrero, Cesar] Unidad Glaciol & Recursos Hidr, Huaraz, Peru",University of Oregon; University of Zurich; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Carey, M (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Robert D Clark Honors Coll, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",carey@uoregon.edu,,,"U.S. National Science Foundation [0822983, DEB 1010550, BCS 0752175]; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation; Direct For Biological Sciences [1010550] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Environmental Biology [1010550] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1010132] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"This article is based upon work supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under grants No. 0822983, DEB 1010550, and BCS 0752175, and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.

The present study evaluates char dwellers? risk perceptions and agricultural adaptations to climate change. Survey data were collected from 98 households, and focus group discussions were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire from Rydas Bari char under the Gaibandha District of Bangladesh. A standardized risk perception index was created using a four point Likert scale against sixteen climatic events. In addition, a binary logit model was used to estimate the influence of socioeconomic characteristics of sample households on the decision to choose climate change adaptation strategies. Findings suggest that droughts, river erosion, and floods are the major climatic risks perceived by char dwellers. Additionally, results from a climate vulnerability index portray similar findings that char respondents are more exposed to diverse climatic hazards. The study further investigates local adaptation mechanisms in agriculture with regards to major climatic events. In response to the existing climate change risks, the char inhabitants employ several adaptation strategies in agriculture such as implementing new or alternative farming practices, changing planting times, and cultivating short-duration varieties. The llogit analysis suggests that household age, family size, annual income, farm size, farm ownership and farming experience have a significant influence on farmers? adaptation choices. Household access to education, early warning by extension agents, information on improved agricultural technologies, access to off-farm sources of income and incorporating char people during policy design can effectively enhance farmers? resilience and help reduce vulnerability.","[Ahmed, Zobaer; Guha, Gauri S.] Arkansas State Univ, Environm Sci Program, Jonesboro, AR 72401 USA; [Shew, Aaron M.] Arkansas State Univ, Coll Agr, Jonesboro, AR USA; [Alam, G.

It was applied across Vietnam as the Government is interested in identifying adaptation options and detailed data are readily available for its 65 provinces. The process involves identifying ecoregions and collating information for each region based on the current conditions and trends in biodiversity, population, income and agricultural production. Climate change scenarios are identified for each region, together with governance options. Educational needs and key adaptation actions are then identified for each region taking into account the agro-ecological and socio-economic input data.

As a result, more research is needed to facilitate the design and implementation of feasible and transparent adaptation strategies for cultural resources under changing climate conditions. In this paper, we begin to explore the challenges and opportunities that face cultural resource managers as they begin to grapple with climate change adaptation planning in dynamic coastal environments. Specifically, we provide an overview of a value-focused, decision-analytic approach that was applied in a pilot test of climate adaptation planning for buildings within designated historic districts on the barrier islands of Cape Lookout National Seashore, North Carolina. We provide descriptions of the challenges that are uniquely facing cultural resource managers and initial evidence of the utility of this type of approach for informing judgments by presenting pre- and post-workshop survey data. Although additional research is critical to offer planning and policy guidance, we found that structured deliberations about cultural resource adaptation planning not only influenced participants' opinions but also provided a necessary space to better understand the complexities of climate and budget uncertainties. Our evaluation is a first step at documenting the difficult and value-laden decisions that must be addressed by cultural resource managers as fiscal constraints and impending climate impacts threaten the traditional approach of preservation in perpetuity.","[Fatoric, Sandra; Seekamp, Erin] North Carolina State Univ, Coll Nat Resources, 2820 Faucette Dr,Campus Box 8004, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Seekamp, E (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Coll Nat Resources, 2820 Faucette Dr,Campus Box 8004, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",sfatori@ncsu.edu; elseekam@ncsu.edu,,"Seekamp, Erin/0000-0001-5082-1921; Fatoric, Sandra/0000-0002-3712-0749",US Geological Survey through the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center; Department of Interior Southeast Climate Science Center [G15AP00141],US Geological Survey through the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center; Department of Interior Southeast Climate Science Center,"This research was supported by the US Geological Survey (http:// www.usgs.gov/) through the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center (https://nccwsc.usgs.gov/) and the Department of Interior Southeast Climate Science Center (http://globalchange.ncsu. edu/secsc/) through grant agreement G15AP00141.

There is also a better understanding of the potentials and constraints on community-based adaptation and the opposition from some landowners to measures to protect and enhance ecosystem services. The paper ends with lessons learnt that contradict some common assumptions - for instance, what approaches best build support for climate change adaptation within local governments, what measures work and from where lessons can be drawn.

A commentary on A way forward on adaptation to climate change in Colombian agriculture: perspectives towards 2050 by J. Ramirez-Villegas, M. Salazar, A. Jarvis, C. E. Navarro-Valcines",CLIMATIC CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,VULNERABILITY; FARMERS; IMPACTS,"Climate change is putting Colombian agriculture under significant stress and, if no adaptation is made, the latter will be severely impacted during the next decades. Ramirez-Villegas et al. (2012) set out a government-led, top-down, techno-scientific proposal for a way forward by which Colombian agriculture could adapt to climate change. However, this proposal largely overlooks the root causes of vulnerability of Colombian agriculture, and of smallholders in particular. I discuss some of the hidden assumptions underpinning this proposal and of the arguments employed by Ramirez-Villegas et al., based on existing literature on Colombian agriculture and the wider scientific debate on adaptation to climate change. While technical measures may play an important role in the adaptation of Colombian agriculture to climate change, I question whether these actions alone truly represent priority issues, especially for smallholders. I suggest that by i) looking at vulnerability before adaptation, ii) contextualising climate change as one of multiple exposures, and iii) truly putting smallholders at the centre of adaptation, i.e. to learn about and with them, different and perhaps more urgent priorities for action can be identified. Ultimately, I argue that what is at stake is not only a list of adaptation measures but, more importantly, the scientific approach from which priorities for action are identified. In this respect, I propose that transformative rather than technical fix adaptation represents a better approach for Colombian agriculture and smallholders in particular, in the face of climate change.","Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading RG66AB, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Feola, G (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading RG66AB, Berks, England.",g.feola@reading.ac.uk,,"Feola, Giuseppe/0000-0003-1069-503X",School of Human and Environmental Sciences; Walker Institute for Climate System Research at the University of Reading,School of Human and Environmental Sciences; Walker Institute for Climate System Research at the University of Reading,I am grateful to Luis Alfonso Agudelo for ongoing discussions on Colombian agriculture and Claudio Szlafsztein for comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.

In this article, we discern how the administrative tradition in the Netherlands, England, and New Zealand impact upon the introduction of adaptive flood risk management approaches. Using the concept of administrative traditions, we aim to explain the similarities and/or differences in how adaptive strategies are shaped and implemented in the three different state flood management regimes and furthermore, which aspects related to administrative traditions are enablers or barriers to innovation in these processes.","[van Buuren, Arwin] Erasmus Univ, Dept Publ Adm & Sociol, Publ Adm, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Lawrence, Judy] Victoria Univ Wellington, Climate Change Res Inst, Wellington, New Zealand; [Potter, Karen] Open Univ, Sch Business, Dept Publ Sect Leadership & Enterprise PuLSE, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England; [Warner, Jeroen F.] Wageningen Univ, Social Sci Grp, Disaster Studies, Wageningen, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Victoria University Wellington; Open University - UK; Wageningen University & Research,"van Buuren, A (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Dept Publ Adm & Sociol, Publ Adm, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",,"Lawrence, Judy/W-9823-2019; van Buuren, Arwin/I-6240-2013","Lawrence, Judy/0000-0001-6798-3636; Potter, Karen/0000-0003-4750-0056; van Buuren, Arwin/0000-0002-8504-0495",,,,,73,16,16,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1541-132X,1541-1338,,REV POLICY RES,Rev.

More educated, experienced, and empowered households are also more likely to have put in place za < pits. Accounting for endogeneity of adoption, zaNu pits are found to significantly increase cereal yields. Our counterfactual analysis reveals that even though all households would benefit from adoption of zai pits, the effect would be significantly larger for households that did not adopt if they had adopted.

Since then, many news media, public officials, and people from both South Korea and abroad have visited the RWHS. In this paper, two years of the system's operational data are presented and its role in short-and long-term climate change adaptation is investigated. The downstream sewer system has become safe for a 50-year rainfall without upgrading the existing sewer system, which was designed for a 10-year period. The 26,000 m(3) of water saved has reduced the energy requirement of transferring water from a distant area. The success of the Star City RWHS has influenced 47 cities across South Korea, including Seoul, to enact regulations on rainwater management. It has shown that decentralized rainwater management can supplement the existing centralized system to ensure its safety.","[Mun, J.

Using the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, as a case study, we present an adaptation framework which addresses the hydrological impacts of climate change at three spatial scales: the high-conservation value asset, the water management unit and the entire basin. At each scale, the appropriate scientific, policy and operational tools differ, though should be applied in concert. At the scale of the asset, hydrodynamic modelling has improved the capacity of site managers to anticipate the effects of management interventions. These models have also contributed to improve hydrological modelling of the water management unit. When combined with ecosystem response models, hydrological models can compare ecological outcomes over a range of timescales, leading to improvements in the representation of environmental requirements in water sharing plans. At the scale of the basin, the Australian government has used a legislative mechanism to set overarching ecological and diversion objectives. In addition, the purchase of water-use entitlements has created a flexible mechanism to use the water market as a climate-change adaptation mechanism, responding to the changing water availability and conservation priorities that emerge over the coming decades.","[Saintilan, Neil; Rogers, Kerrylee] NSW Dept Premier & Cabinet, Off Environm & Heritage, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Ralph, Timothy J.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Office of Environment & Heritage - New South Wales; Macquarie University,"Saintilan, N (corresponding author), NSW Dept Premier & Cabinet, Off Environm & Heritage, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",neil.saintilan@environment.nsw.gov.au,"Ralph, Timothy/A-9853-2012; Rogers, Kerrylee/AAC-8093-2022; Ralph, Timothy J./N-1520-2019","Ralph, Timothy/0000-0002-4956-606X; Ralph, Timothy J./0000-0002-4956-606X; Saintilan, Neil/0000-0001-9226-2005; Rogers, Kerrylee/0000-0003-1350-4737",,,,,58,10,10,1,72,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,MAY,2013,708,1,,,,,97,109,,10.1007/s10750-011-0970-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-011-0970-3,,,13,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Marine & Freshwater Biology,126OW,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000317628200007,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper reports on the success, failures and future risks of the responses taken by the South East Queensland (SEQ) water sector during the Millennium Drought. The adaptation strategy employed a portfolio approach mixing 'hard' and 'soft' adaptations. Strategies included the following: large-scale water manufacturing facilities and distribution networks; the exploitation of local water resources; regulatory instruments; institutional reforms; support for research and training and a range of demand management programmes. The strategies employed were innovative and in many cases required rigorous scientific evidence for their development, implementation and follow-up assessments. However, we show that there has been considerable disparity between anticipated and actual policy outcomes, which points to maladaptive consequences. By revisiting the effectiveness of implemented adaptation strategies in the SEQ water sector, our paper provides evidence for the need for integrative studies with genuine policy integration.","[Laves, G.; Roiko, A.] Griffith Univ, Urban Res Program, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Kenway, S.; Begbie, D.] Urban Water Secur Res Alliance, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Carter, R.

The process varied slightly between cities and generated indicators that were chosen for their contextual fit and availability of data.

Social learning approaches have emerged as a promising way to address the issue of adaptation to climate change. This paper examines the structuring of a business strategy for adaptation in a Brazilian thermoplastic resin and petrochemical company to exemplify the extent to which internal changes in the organization's understanding, norms and values derived from a social learning process. Hence, the main research question is how are learning processes within a company organizational learning-and social interaction in a Community of Practice-social learning-related and how do they contribute to leveraging changes in management practices in a company's adaptation to climate change? The case study presents how the company's representatives' participation in a social learning process within a CoP supported not only the development of a comprehensive adaptation strategy but also the mainstreaming of climate concepts, impacts and adaptation actions. Therefore, it demonstrated that combining social learning and organization learning processes is useful to consistently build resilience, given that they are mutually supportive in the recognition of the relevance of adaptation, the dissemination of risk perception throughout the organization and the development of an internal capacity to continuously plan and act.

This kind of mismatch is clearly evident in the field of climate change adaptation, arguing for the design and application of user- and decision-driven, coproduced climate services. Science-based participatory processes have shown clear benefits in establishing arenas for joint knowledge production on climate change and adaptation. However, multiple challenges remain.

We attempt to address this gap by using a multidisciplinary investigative approach that taps into the perceptions of local people in the Maluti-a-Phofung Local Municipality in the Free state province of South Africa and what is available in the literature. This approach is helpful because it ensures that local people's perceptions, alongside other objectively informed insights, are systematically integrated into the co-designing of actionable climate-change adaption strategies.

We conducted an empirical study of the barriers and requirements to adapting to climate change of 539 peasant households in an ecologically vulnerable area of China to enhance their resilience to climate change by improving our understanding of adaptation process and decision-making. Our findings indicated that farmers in the Gannan Plateau face multiple adaptation barriers, of which normative, information and technology barriers were more serious, such as lack of meteorological information service, infrastructure and technology extension in agriculture or animal husbandry. Adaptation requirements are an important way to effectively reduce or eliminate obstacles and improve farmers' adaptive capacity to climate change. The survey found that local households have an urgent requirement for infrastructure, information and production technologies, such as water, electricity, transportation facilities, disaster warning information, employment information and farming or breeding techniques. In addition, due to the influence of economic level, education level, years of farming, gender and other factors, differences exist in the adaptation barriers and requirements faced by farmers in different regions. These findings extend empirical evidence in favor of formulating a reasonable adaptation framework and choosing optimal adaptation strategies, which are essential for enacting well-targeted regional adaptation policies.","[Wang, Weijun; Zhao, Xueyan; Cao, Jianjun; Li, Hua] Northwest Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Environm Sci, 967 Anning East Rd, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qin] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing, Peoples R China",Northwest Normal University - China; Beijing Normal University,"Zhao, XY (corresponding author), Northwest Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Environm Sci, 967 Anning East Rd, Lanzhou, Peoples R China.",wjwangnwnu@126.com; zhaoxy@nwnu.edu.cn; caojj@nwnu.edu.cn; lihuanwnu@163.com; zhangqinbz@163.com,"Cao, Jianjun/HHM-6335-2022",,"A Category of Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19040502]; National Nature Sciences Foundation of China [41661115]; Key Laboratory of Ecohydrology of Inland River Basin, Chinese Academy of Sciences [KLEIRB-25-16-03]","A Category of Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Nature Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Laboratory of Ecohydrology of Inland River Basin, Chinese Academy of Sciences","This work was supported by A Category of Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant no.

An analysis of 28 state action plans,CLIMATE POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; adaptation; gender; intersectionality; mainstreaming; India,AGRICULTURAL-RESEARCH; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; INTERSECTIONALITY; VULNERABILITY; POLITICS; WOMEN; CASTE,"Gender mediates climate vulnerability and adaptation action. Consequently, climate change adaptation policy has seen a push towards 'mainstreaming' gender and prioritizing 'gender-responsive' climate action. However, it is unclear to what extent this mainstreaming advances or obscures gender considerations and whether current climate policies reflect developments in the gender and climate change literature. This paper explores how gender is operationalized in adaptation policy in India through a policy review of 28 State Action Plans on Climate Change. We juxtapose normative goals around reducing differential vulnerability with policy approaches to mainstreaming gender and propose entry points that link advances in gender and feminist studies with climate change adaptation policy. Our analysis indicates that most subnational climate policies in India explicitly mention gender as a mediator of vulnerability and adaptive capacity but operationalize it inadequately and unevenly. We also reflect on how the heuristics of mainstreaming get operationalized in policies (gender-blind, gender-sensitive, to gender-transformative approaches) and what that means for addressing gendered vulnerability. Key policy insights While explicitly mentioned, gender concerns are unevenly operationalized in India's subnational climate policy. In most State Action Plans on Climate Change in India, gaps exist between normative goals such as reducing differential vulnerability and empowering women, and policy approaches (namely gender-blind, -neutral, -specific, -sensitive, and -transformative approaches). To be effective, the conceptualization of gender must expand beyond focussing on differences between women and men to engaging more with intersections of sex, caste, class, and resources.","[Singh, Chandni] Indian Inst Human Settlements, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Solomon, Divya] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Rao, Nitya] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich, Norfolk, England",Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS); University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of East Anglia,"Singh, C (corresponding author), Indian Inst Human Settlements, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",csingh@iihs.ac.in,,"Solomon, Divya/0000-0003-0373-9356; Singh, Chandni/0000-0001-6842-6735",,,,,88,4,4,9,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Then, we apply these principles to analyze the adaptation planning pro-cesses in the cultural landscapes of Cinque Terre (Italy) and the Region of Waterloo (Canada).

This paper focusses on public buildings as part of a public asset. Design/methodology/approach - As an archipelagic country, Indonesia is very vulnerable to sea-level rise as a result of climate change. The outcomes of a qualitative analysis of interviews with relevant stakeholders were used for the development of the CCA framework in an Indonesian context. Findings - The study identified that the integration of CCA in PAM in Indonesia requires the incorporation of nine key elements. These are as follows: recognition of climate change; risk management and insurance schemes for assets; integrated asset management and planning; asset use and knowledge; reliable, accessible and understandable data set on climate change; leadership, government commitment and incentives; involvement of research and private entities; community engagement; and coordination of relevant agencies. Research limitations/implications - This paper informed only the key elements required on the development of framework which integrate CCA in PAM. Practical implications - The integration of CCA to a PAM framework will support the development of policies and procedures for better-informed decisions. Social implications - The framework increases opportunities for stakeholders and community engagement in policy development and decision making in relation to CCA for public assets. Originality/value - This paper synthesises CCA and PAM using knowledge from the three levels of governments in Australia and Indonesia. CCA and PAM groups work separately in Indonesia and integration will reduce climate change risks and improve decision making in PAM.","[Lukito, Jose Arif; Susilawati, Connie; Goonetilleke, Ashantha] Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Sci & Engn, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Susilawati, C (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Sci & Engn, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",c.susilawati@qut.edu.au,"Goonetilleke, Ashantha/I-9689-2012","Goonetilleke, Ashantha/0000-0002-8783-1223; Susilawati, Connie/0000-0001-5930-8331",,,,,70,0,0,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2398-4708,,,INT J BUILD PATHOL,Int.

However, there are various uncertainties and challenges associated with the impacts of displacement and attachments to place. In this context, it is useful to study past examples of relocation to understand how these challenges have been addressed. This paper draws on a case study relocation scheme which took place in Ireland following major flooding in 1954. This represented a radical and comprehensive approach to relocation which sought to address the root causes of vulnerability. The analysis shows that this comprehensive approach was made possible through a connection between managed retreat and land reform. The scheme also faced opposition linked to attachments to place and property. This led to compromises and a failure to fully address the effects of flooding on livelihoods but contributed to resilience through ensuring that family and community ties remained intact. The paper's distinctive contributions are its analysis of the requirements of transformative approaches to adaptation and relocation, its identification of challenges associated with place and property even in the context of such transformative approaches, and its adding of historical depth to contemporary debates on climate adaptation.","[Tubridy, Daniel; Scott, Mark; Lennon, Mick] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Architecture Planning & Environm Policy, Dublin 4, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Tubridy, D (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Architecture Planning & Environm Policy, Dublin 4, Ireland.",tubridyd@tcd.ie; mark.scott@ucd.ie; michael.lennon@ucd.ie,,"Scott, Mark/0000-0002-8053-5720; Lennon, Mick/0000-0001-8613-092X; Tubridy, Fiadh/0000-0002-1934-6883",Irish Centre for Applied Geosciences (iCRAG) under Science Foundation Ireland [13/RC2092],Irish Centre for Applied Geosciences (iCRAG) under Science Foundation Ireland,UThis research was supported by Irish Centre for Applied Geosciences (iCRAG) under Science Foundation Ireland [grant number 13/RC2092].,,52,3,3,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0266-5433,1466-4518,,PLAN PERSPECT,Plan.

This paper argues that governance scholars can learn much from organisation theory, more specifically regarding the conceptualisation of change and intervention strategies. We reconceptualise the divide between transformational change and incremental change by questioning the feasibility of changes that are concurrently in-depth, large scale, and quick; and the assumption that incremental change is necessarily slow and can only result in superficial changes. To go beyond this dichotomy, we introduce the conceptualisation of continuous transformational change. Resulting intervention strategies include (1) providing basic conditions for enabling small in-depth wins; (2) amplifying small wins through sensemaking, coupling, and integrating; and (3) unblocking stagnations by confronting social and cognitive fixations with counterintuitive interventions.

J,"Craig, RK",,,,"Craig, Robin Kundis",,,STATIONARITY IS DEAD - LONG LIVE TRANSFORMATION: FIVE PRINCIPLES FOR CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION LAW,HARVARD ENVIRONMENTAL LAW REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INCENTIVES; RESILIENCE; FRAMEWORK,"While there is no question that successful mitigation strategies remain critical in the quest to avoid worst-case climate change scenarios, we have passed the point where mitigation efforts alone can deal with the problems that climate change is creating. Because of committed warming climate change that will occur regardless of mitigation measures, a result of the already-accumulated greenhouse gases in the atmosphere what happens to coupled socio-ecological systems over the next decades, and most likely over the next few centuries, will largely be beyond human control. The time to start preparing for these changes is now, by making adaptation part of a national climate change policy. American environmental law and policy are not keeping up with the need for adaptation. For example, environmental and natural resources law are currently based on assumptions of ecological stationarity and pursue goals of preservation and restoration. Neither those assumptions nor those goals fit a world of continual, unpredictable, and nonlinear transformations of complex ecosystems but that is the world that climate change is creating. This Article argues for a principled flexibility model of climate change adaptation law to pursue goals of increasing the resilience and adaptive capacity of socioecological systems. In so doing, it lays out five principles and several subprinciples for the law of environmental regulation and natural resource management. Structurally, this Article also strongly suggests that climate change adaptation law must be bimodal: it must promote informed and principled flexibility when dealing with climate change impacts, especially impacts that affect baseline ecological conditions such as temperature and hydrology, while simultaneously embracing an unyielding commitment to precautionary regulation when dealing with everything else.","Florida State Univ, Coll Law, Environm Programs, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Craig, RK (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Coll Law, Environm Programs, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",rcraig@law.fsu.edu,"Craig, Robin Kundis/GPX-3135-2022; Craig, Robin Kundis/U-7318-2018","Craig, Robin Kundis/0000-0003-2120-9543; Craig, Robin Kundis/0000-0003-2120-9543",,,,,172,206,209,2,75,HARVARD LAW SCHOOL,CAMBRIDGE,"PUBLICATIONS CTR, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA",0147-8257,,,HARVARD ENVIRON LAW,Harv.

This paper utilises three Pacific island nation case-studies, Kiribati, Samoa and Vanuatu, to review current NbS approaches to adapt and mitigate the converging resilience challenges of climate change and urbanisation. We look at associated government policies, current NbS experience, and offer insights into opportunities for future work with focus on urban areas. These three Pacific island case-studies showcase their rich cultural and biological diversity and, importantly, the role of traditional ecological knowledge in shaping localised, place-based, NbS for climate change adaptation and enhanced wellbeing.

Many innovative strategies for adapting to climate change have been implemented in developed countries. To achieve the goal of climate change adaptation for agricultural land, a vulnerability assessment of farmland is indispensable. Based on the research framework of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this study applied the structure of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptation to build criteria and conduct an evaluation of a designated area in Southern Taiwan. We identified the key factors of the vulnerability of farmland, through mapping with spatial analysis, and by using geographic information system tools. The main purpose of the application of a vulnerability assessment is not to explicitly describe the status of agricultural land to climate change, but to help local government and farmers to identify the critical area, and to discuss the appropriated adaptive policies. According to the results of the vulnerability assessment of agricultural land, the entire study region can be divided into three patterns: Pattern 1, located in the western coastal zone, filled with various attributes of high vulnerability; Pattern 2, distributed on the central plain region in the east, with complete blocks of agricultural land and low vulnerability; and Pattern 3, located in the central plain region to the west, a region in which areas with various vulnerability levels. The following three types of adaptation strategies for climate change for farmland were established: (1) the enhancement of agricultural production, (2) the maintenance of agricultural production, and (3) the conservation of the agricultural environment. The current results can serve as valuable guidelines for governments to implement feasible local adaptation strategies in the future.","[Huang, Kuo-Ching; Lee, Chen-Jai; Chan, Shih-Liang; Tai, Cheng-Hsin] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Real Estate & Built Environm, New Taipei 237303, Taiwan",National Taipei University,"Huang, KC (corresponding author), Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Real Estate & Built Environm, New Taipei 237303, Taiwan.",kuoching.huang@gmail.com; audio@gm.ntpu.edu.tw; slchan@mail.ntpu.edu.tw; shin@mail.ntpu.edu.tw,,"Huang, Kuo-Ching/0000-0003-3185-6189","Council of Agriculture, Taiwan (R.O.C) [109-AgriMana-1.3-Plan-02]","Council of Agriculture, Taiwan (R.O.C)","This research was funded by the Council of Agriculture, Taiwan (R.O.C) under grant number 101-AgriTech-14-1-1-Plan-Q2.

This paper presents a framework for evaluating permafrost mapping exercises designed to inform climate change adaptation actions. We apply the framework using a case study of the Incorporating Climate Change into Land DevelopmentTerrain Analysis project (ICCiLD). ICCiLD is a hazard mapping project utilizing interferometric synthetic aperture radar to monitor ground disturbance and categorize land development suitability in seven communities in the territory of Nunavut, Canada. We looked at one of the communities, Arviat, as our case study. We examined technical data and drew upon semi-structured interviews (n=19) with map creators and users. We found ICCiLD added new and relevant information for community planning, increased awareness of the risks posed by permafrost thaw and built stakeholder relations. Strong coordination and high public consciousness of local climate impacts emerged as key factors underpinning project success. Nevertheless, in the case of Arviat, the effectiveness of the hazard maps in influencing land-use planning was constrained by communication challenges between project creators and end-users. These challenges included limited community access to the data and uncertainty surrounding how to operationalize the map suitability classifications. Broader climate change adaptation challenges included the presence of other more immediate community planning priorities and a limited ability to incorporate Indigenous ways of knowing into a technical mapping project. The lessons from this evaluation provide insight for the development of mapping-based adaptations across Arctic regions.","[Flynn, Melanie; Ford, James D.] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Ford, James D.; Labbe, Jolene] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Schrott, Lothar] Univ Bonn, United Nations Univ Environm Risk & Human Secur, Bonn, Germany; [Tagalik, Shirley] Aqqiumavvik Soc, Arviat Wellness Ctr, Arviat, NU, Canada",University of Leeds; McGill University; University of Bonn,"Flynn, M (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",gy08mjf@leeds.ac.uk,"Ford, James/A-4284-2013; Schrott, Lothar/N-3728-2015","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456; Flynn, Melanie/0000-0003-0015-394X; Schrott, Lothar/0000-0003-0882-7136",Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council; International Development Research Centre; ArcticNet; Canadian Institutes of Health Research Applied Public Health Chair,Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); International Development Research Centre; ArcticNet; Canadian Institutes of Health Research Applied Public Health Chair(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),"Special thanks to the community of Arviat who provided insight and logistical support for this research.

Many experts attribute the receding shorelines and apparent rise in sea levels around Pacific island countries to climate change. It is questionable whether ordinary people are making similar connections. Raising the level of concern about climate change is essential if this is to change. This paper argues that civil society, in the form of non-government organisations (NGOs), offers a very effective means for creating this change. Non-government organisations work closely with local communities, and can use this relationship to communicate the need to give urgent attention to climate change issues. NGOs also have access to policy makers, including government, which they can use to help align policies with community priorities.","Univ Canterbury, Macmillan Brown Ctr Pacific Studies, Christchurch 1, New Zealand",University of Canterbury,"Iati, I (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Macmillan Brown Ctr Pacific Studies, Christchurch 1, New Zealand.",,,,,,,,47,11,11,4,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0032-3187,,,POLIT SCI,Polit.

These frontiers refer to going beyond the (1) incremental vs. transformational and (2) maladaptation vs. adaptation dichotomies and to advancing knowledge on (3) adaptation measures' effectiveness and roles in designing context-specific adaptation pathways. Recent Findings Dealing with adaptation to climate change on the ground often means answering three obvious but critical questions: what to do, where and when? These questions challenge the scientific community's capacity to link conceptual advances (e.g. on transformative adaptation) and ground-rooted needs across sectors and regions (on solutions, governance arrangements, etc.). We argue that the three abovementioned frontiers represent the most burning challenges to the Adaptation Science community to help addressing climate-related societal needs. We also demonstrate that they are intertwined as moving one frontier forward will facilitate moving the others forward.","[Magnan, Alexandre K.; Duvat, Virginie K.

A critique of resilience and climate-resilient development,GEOFORUM,,,English,Article,,,,,,Adaptation; Resilience; Vulnerability; Climate justice; Climate change; Development,INSTITUTIONAL ETHNOGRAPHY; COLLECTIVE ACTION; POST-POLITICS; SOCIAL-CHANGE; JUSTICE; VULNERABILITY; COMMUNITY; POLICY; POWER; PERSPECTIVE,"Over the last two decades, resilience has steadily gained traction in discussions on the theory and practice of adaptation to climate change. The concept is widely considered useful for explaining how coupled social-ecological systems (SESs) resist climate-related stressors or undergo change. At the same time, however, there has been an upswell of critique on resilience and climate-resilient development, stemming most prominently from the quarters of political ecology and human geography. This article seeks to contribute to this literature by using the analytical lens of post-politics to critically evaluate resilience and climate-resilient development in a local adaptation context. Four major critiques are lodged against resilience: (1) its inability to sufficiently recognize the large-scale political, economic, and social forces affecting and effecting change, (2) its oversight of the analyzed systems' internal dynamics, (3) the depoliticized, techno-managerial nature of resilience-centered solutions, and (4) the theoretical vagueness of resilience as applied by development actors. The paper presents a grounded critique of the term based on empirical evidence collected through a quasi-ethnography of a climate change adaptation project implemented by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the national government in Sao Tome and Principe. It is argued that resilience, despite its theoretical attractiveness and growing popularity among donors, continues to dehumanize development and renders adaptation post-political. The article also discusses alternative, more human-centered approaches rooted in vulnerability and climate justice, which offer a more nuanced lens through which to analyze climate impacts and the associated challenges that they pose at the local level.","[Mikulewicz, Michael] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Ctr Climate Justice, Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland",Glasgow Caledonian University,"Mikulewicz, M (corresponding author), Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Ctr Climate Justice, Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland.",michael.mikulewicz@gcu.ac.uk,,,"University of Manchester President's Doctoral Scholar Award; School of Environment, Education and Development (SEED)","University of Manchester President's Doctoral Scholar Award; School of Environment, Education and Development (SEED)","This research was supported by the University of Manchester President's Doctoral Scholar Award (2014-2017); and fieldwork allowance from the School of Environment, Education and Development (SEED).",,148,41,42,4,33,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0016-7185,1872-9398,,GEOFORUM,Geoforum,AUG,2019,104,,,,,,267,282,,10.1016/j.geoforum.2019.05.010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2019.05.010,,,16,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,IN5GO,,Green Accepted,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000478704100025,View Full Record in Web of Science

A Poststructuralist Approach to Climate Change Adaptation,ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ACTOR-NETWORK THEORY; HUMAN-ENVIRONMENT; HYBRID-GEOGRAPHIES; HUMAN DIMENSIONS; POLITICS; VULNERABILITY; KNOWLEDGE; RISK; PERSPECTIVES; GOVERNANCE,"This article calls for a stronger engagement by geographers with the concept of socionature as a vehicle for guiding adaptation thinking in development planning. Drawing on literatures from poststructuralist geographies, it argues for a relational, hybrid ontology of climate change adaptation grounded in multiple perspectives, knowledges, and more-than-human relations. Going beyond this stance, a framework based on the idea of planning with climate change is proposed for a revised approach to adaptation that calls for more-than-social planning practices embedded in radically more integrative planning processes and the redistribution of power across the climate and planning systems. The article ends by highlighting some of the key challenges that such a project faces for scholars working in the field of planning and development research. Key Words: climate change adaptation, development, human geography, planning, poststructuralist theory.?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????Este art?culo clama por un compromiso m?s fuerte de los ge?grafos con el concepto de socionaturaleza, como veh?culo que gu?e el pensamiento de adaptaci?n en la planificaci?n del desarrollo.

In recent years, increasing scholarly attention has been focused on the governance of adaptation, which has included exploring alternatives to state-centric models of decision-making and identifying appropriate roles and responsibilities of multiple actors to achieve desired outcomes. Scholars have called for greater clarity in distinguishing between different approaches to adaptation governance. Drawing on the rich scholarship about public governance, this article articulates and applies a typology of four modes of governance by which adaptation takes place (hierarchy, market, network, and community). Using examples of initiatives from across Canada, the article offers a frame-work for describing, comparing, and evaluating the governance of adaptation initiatives.","[Bednar, Danny] Western Univ, Dept Geog, London N6A 3K7, England; [Henstra, Daniel] Univ Waterloo, Dept Polit Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Bednar, D (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Geog, London N6A 3K7, England.",dbednar@uwo.ca; dhenstra@uwaterloo.ca,,"Henstra, Daniel/0000-0003-0224-9152",,,,,58,9,10,0,11,COGITATIO PRESS,LISBON,"RUA FIALHO ALMEIDA 14, 2 ESQ, LISBON, 1070-129, PORTUGAL",2183-2463,,,POLITICS GOV,Politics Gov.,,2018,6,3,,,,,147,158,,10.17645/pag.v6i3.1432,http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/pag.v6i3.1432,,,12,Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Government & Law,HB0QQ,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000450722500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

These small reservoirs, referred to as 'tanks', were initially constructed to collect the local runoff and this practice gradually evolved into the construction of larger tanks. Originally tanks were primarily managed by local communities to suit their livelihoods, often as linked Small Tank Cascade Systems (STCS). During the British colonial period, community-led management structures were disregarded and largely disbanded as government converted the governance of larger water storages into centrally managed structures. Since independence, the management of STCS has passed through various government agencies. This paper describes the management of STCS through history and identifies major issues in the current governance model and the challenges and opportunities associated with renewed interest in STCS to support adaptation to climate change. We conclude that contemporary challenges in using STCS for climate adaptation result from past inadequacies in the governance of this water resource.","[Kekulandala, Bhathiya; Jacobs, Brent; Cunningham, Rebecca] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Bldg 10,Level 10,235 Jones,St Ultimo, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Kekulandala, B (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Bldg 10,Level 10,235 Jones,St Ultimo, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",bhathiya.kekulandala@uts.edu.au,,"Cunningham, Rebecca/0000-0001-8066-9019; Kekulandala, Bhathiya/0000-0002-1872-4926",Australian Government Research Training Program,Australian Government Research Training Program(Australian Government),"This research is supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.

Largely as a result of their colonial history, island nations are dependent on outside funders to adapt to climate change, reproducing colonial subordination by depriving island states of sovereignty over their adaptation strategies. We empirically demonstrate the sovereignty-depriving effects of the current adaptation process through a case study from the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI). Recent scholarship suggests that, without swift and large-scale adaptation, RMI will be uninhabitable by mid-century, threatening a population-scale forced migration. Our research indicates that Marshallese leaders are committed to adapting in place in order to preserve national identity and sovereignty, but they view reliance on external funding as a major barrier to implementing the measures that could enable RMI to survive in the face of climate change. Marshallese decision-makers in this study perceive that aid institutions discount the existential implications of failing to pursue aggressive adaptation, assuming instead that migration is inevitable, economically rational, and even desirable. Such a proposal is particularly painful given the history of forced migration in RMI caused by U.S. nuclear weapons testing there. These neocolonial dynamics not only deprive island states of sovereignty over their adaptation strategies but also threaten permanent abrogation of national sovereignty and selfdetermination through loss of a habitable territory. To uphold global commitments to decolonization and human rights, our research indicates the need to return sovereignty over climate adaptation decision-making to affected states.","[Bordner, Autumn S.; Ferguson, Caroline E.; Ortolano, Leonard] Stanford Univ, Emmett Interdisciplinary Program Environm & Resou, 473 Via Ortega Rd,Y2E2 Bldg,Suite 226, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bordner, Autumn S.] Stanford Law Sch, 559 Nathan Abbot Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ortolano, Leonard] Stanford Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Jerry Yang & Akiko Yamazaki Environm & Energy Bld, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University; Stanford University,"Ferguson, CE (corresponding author), 473 Via Ortega Room 311, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",autumn@blueoceanlaw.com; cefergus@stanford.edu; ortolano@stanford.edu,,"Ferguson, Caroline/0000-0002-6243-6091","Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources, Stanford University","Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources, Stanford University","This work was supported by the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources, Stanford University.",,64,29,28,0,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

This paper presents main methodological developments and results of an inter- and transdisciplinary research that was applied to the Vercors massif in southeastern France. The approach linked regional climate projections with impacts on social-ecological systems and socio-economic activities, as well as adaptation capacities and management responses. We built on an extensive participatory process and an in-depth analysis of expert and local knowledge. This process provided a generic and transdisciplinary knowledge model together with an integrated framework for adaptation management (AMS-MAIA method). Our analyses showed that many adaptation practices were already underway in the study area, implicitly or explicitly, and highlighted key functions and some relevant cross-sectoral insights for adaptation. The research also assisted in collecting information on climate sensitivity through social-ecological indicators across spatial units. It provided resources and a prototype of web-based tools to assist local communities in setting up cross-sectoral adaptation strategies. We thus offer an original method for governing adaptation based on management standards and continuous improvement, while highlighting limitations of such formal and stringent approaches that require social and political license.","[Tschanz, Leita; Arlot, Marie-Pierre; Philippe, Felix; Vidaud, Laure; Maldonado, Eric; George, Emmanuelle; Spiegelberger, Thomas] Univ Grenoble Alpes, INRAE, LESSEM, 2 Rue Papeterie, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Tschanz, Leita] Avignon Univ, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS IRD, UMR7263, Marseille, France; [Morin, Samuel] Univ Toulouse, Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRSC, Meteo France,NRM,Ctr Etudes La Neige, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Spiegelberger, Thomas] Univ Grenoble Alpes, INRAE, LTSER France, Zone Atelier Alpes, F-38000 Grenoble, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); INRAE; Avignon Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Meteo France; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); INRAE,"Arlot, MP (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, INRAE, LESSEM, 2 Rue Papeterie, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France.",ltschanz@gmail.com; marie-pierre.arlot@inrae.fr; felix.philippe@inrae.fr; laure.vidaud@inrae.fr; samuel.morin@meteo.fr; eric.maldonado@inrae.fr; emmanuelle.george@inrae.fr; thomas.spiegelberger@inrae.fr,"Morin, Samuel/E-8005-2011","Morin, Samuel/0000-0002-1781-687X",French Ministry of the Environment; Technology Transfer Acceleration Company SATT Linksium in Grenoble; INRAE; French Agence Nationale pour la Recherche,French Ministry of the Environment; Technology Transfer Acceleration Company SATT Linksium in Grenoble; INRAE; French Agence Nationale pour la Recherche(French National Research Agency (ANR)),This project was funded by the French Ministry of the Environment.

However less is known about how information functions as a barrier, and to what degree it prevents adaptation compared to other perceived barriers. In addition, the role of institutional context in mediating the demand for information in the context of adaptation has been less well studied. This paper helps to clarify the role that information plays in adaptation planning for two sectors of public employees working at similar scales, in similar locations, with similar challenges. We conducted surveys and semi-structured interviews to investigate the demand for information in support of adaptation implementation and planning from US federal public lands managers and municipal officials in the US interior West. We found that federal managers and municipal officials both consulted information frequently for decision making, and while both groups indicated that lack of information at relevant scales was a barrier to adaptation planning, this was seen as a much stronger barrier for federal managers than for communities. Uncertainty of information was raised as an issue, but results were mixed on whether or not this acted as a strong barrier. While peer-reviewed publications were seen as the best available science, and correlated with adaptation planning, they were not accessed directly as frequently as other sources of information, including colleagues, the Internet and reports. The strong connection between communities and adjacent federal lands may provide an opportunity for networking that could facilitate the flow of information relevant for adaptation.

As billions of development aid dollars are being mobilised around this new theme there are risks that adaptation efforts of the development sector will result in familiar problems. In this paper we draw upon postdevelopment perspectives that critically consider development aid and the role of the development sector to scrutinise emerging approaches to adaptation. We suggest that a postdevelopment approach to adaptation contributes a much-needed analysis of the agendas that are shaping adaptation discourses and helps us to see nascent possibilities for adaptation that are already unfolding in diverse localities.

We therefore developed the framework SAER (Stimuli-Actions-Effects-Responses) to investigate perceived relationships between private and public climate change adaptation in agriculture at regional scale. In particular, we explore agricultural experts' perceptions on (i) climatic and non climatic factors stimulating private adaptation, (ii) farm adaption actions, (iii) potential on-farm and off-farm effects from adaptation, and (iv) the relationships between private and public adaptation. The SAER-framework is built on a comprehensive literature review and empirical findings from semi structured interviews with agricultural experts from two case study regions in Austria. We find that private adaptation is perceived as incremental, systemic or transformational. It is typically stimulated by a mix of bio-physical and socio-economic on-farm and off-farm factors. Stimulating factors related to climate change are perceived of highest relevance for systemic and transformational adaptation whereas already implemented adaptation is mostly perceived to be incremental. Perceived effects of private adaptation are related to the environment, weather and climate, quality and quantity of agricultural products as well as human, social and economic resources. Our results also show that public adaptation can influence factors stimulating private adaptation as well as adaptation effects through the design and development of the legal, policy and organizational environment as well as the provision of educational, informational, financial, and technical infrastructure. Hence, facilitating existing and new collaborations between private and public actors may enable farmers to adapt effectively to climate change. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The literature suggests that landscape is a complex and dynamic socio-ecological system, the management and adaptation of which requires systemic and integrative approaches to respond to a wide variety of drivers of change, challenges, and interests. Based on activities developed in 15 European pilot landscapes, we identify some of the key factors and conditions affecting the generation of representative local networks for landscape adaptation to climate change. We illustrate how social learning and co-creation processes can be implemented in them and how their co-produced outcomes can help local communities overcome barriers and address critical issues in adaptive planning. Our results provide a framework for the creation of similar networks in other landscapes, exploring at the same time the interactions between the composition of networks, social learning, and the quality of the co-produced outputs as a fundamental step for the development of Landscape Adaptation Plans to Climate Change.","[Galan, Juanjo] Aalto Univ, Dept Architecture, Otaniementie 14, Espoo 02150, Finland; [Galan, Juanjo] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Urbanism, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Galiana, Francisco] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Rural & Agrifood Engn, Cami Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Kotze, D.

Yet, limited information exists on the context-specific effectiveness of local adaptation of agronomic practices. The Near East and North Africa (NENA) region is one of the world's regions with the lowest per capita natural resources availability and one of the most vulnerable to climate change. For these reasons, there is an urgent need to improve the development and implementation of adaptation plans and actions to cope with climate change. This research implements the systematic review (SR) methodology to assess the scientific literature in adopting climate change adaptation practices for agriculture at the farm level in the NENA region. Results highlight a significant knowledge gap in adaptation in the region and recommend intensifying targeted research and funding to cope with urgent regional climate risks to rural and agricultural livelihoods. Key policy insights: A limited number of studies assess the costs and benefits of climate change adaptation options for the agricultural sector in the NENA region, with a majority of these published in the last ten years. Adapting crop management techniques to climate risks generates a net improvement in Near East and North Africa yields. However, adaptation responses aiming to increase agrosystems resilience show context-specific effectiveness. Water management options, which benefit crop water use efficiency to different extents, present relatively high implementation costs. Integrated management options show the potential to achieve additional multidimensional benefits. Still, well-designed long-term experiments are required to evaluate these practices in the different farming systems under present and projected climate conditions. An urgent need is to promote adaptation research for the various farming systems in the NENA region and to estimate the cost of adaptation measures to guarantee farmer incomes and food security in the face of climate change.","[El Chami, Daniel] Timac Agro Italia SpA, Ripalta Arpina, Italy; [Trabucco, Antonio; Mereu, Valentina] Euro Mediterranean Ctr Climate Change CMCC Fdn, Impacts Agr Forests & Ecosyst Serv IAFES Div, Via Nicola 9, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Wong, Theresa; Monem, Mohamed Abdel] FAO Reg Off Near East & North Africa, Cairo, Egypt",,"Mereu, V (corresponding author), Euro Mediterranean Ctr Climate Change CMCC Fdn, Impacts Agr Forests & Ecosyst Serv IAFES Div, Via Nicola 9, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",valentina.mereu@cmcc.it,"Mereu, Valentina/K-1398-2018","Mereu, Valentina/0000-0002-6402-7179; Trabucco, Antonio/0000-0002-0743-3680",United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) [GF.RNEGD.RA2010200RIN2],United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO),This work was supported by United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) [FAO Budget Code: GF.RNEGD.RA2010200RIN2].,,94,2,2,9,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

This paper examines whether green infrastructure (GI), specifically increased tree planting, could help Hangzhou City adapt to some of these impacts. The paper reports the results of a survey of Hangzhou green-space users and their disposition toward tree planting in public and communal green-spaces as a climate change adaptive response. Results show that surveyed green-space users tended to favor tree planting as an adaptive strategy if they were older, believed that individual actions could reduce climate change impacts, and believed that future climate change impacts would be economically disruptive. Few respondents reported tree costs (disservices). While the perceived benefits of urban trees were unrelated to support for urban greening, results suggest that under some conditions, residents may be willing to support increased tree cover within urban public and communal open spaces. Findings suggest land use planners and environmental managers in China would do well to cultivate support for green infrastructure interventions among older green-space users and residents who perceive personal costs associated with climate change. Additional research across a range of Chinese cities, and internationally, could further assist in evaluating the efficacy of green infrastructure for climate change adaptation from a green-space user perspective. Particular attention will need to be given to the potential costs of large-scale tree planting (e.g. health impacts) and to the utility of GI for macro-scale climate change response.

However, alongside intensified funding flows aimed at climate change adaptation, increased efforts in planning, monitoring, and evaluating of projects are necessary to avoid ineffective interventions or maladaptive outcomes. Yet, often the analytical tools available to the policy maker do not capture the cognitive and affective processes leading to adaptation decisions. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a conceptual framework for planning, monitoring, and evaluating climate adaptation interventions that draws upon the decision-making literature. The framework enables tracing how extrinsic factors (personal and external environment characteristics) and intrinsic factors (knowledge and attitudes) influence the decision to participate in an intervention and its outcomes.

A review of research reveals that urban, coastal, and agricultural land markets provide effective signals of the emerging costs of climate change. These signals encourage adjustments by both private owners and policy officials in taking preemptive action to reduce costs. In agriculture, they promote consideration of new cropping and tillage practices, seed types, timing, and location of production. They also stimulate use of new irrigation technologies. In urban areas, they motivate new housing construction, elevation, and location away from harm. They channel more efficient use of water and its application to parks and other green areas to make urban settings more desirable with higher temperatures. Related water markets play a similar role in adjusting water use and reallocation. To be effective, however, markets must reflect multiple traders and prices must be free to adjust. Where these conditions are not met, market signals will be inhibited and market-driven adaptation will be reduced. Because public policy is driven by constituent demands, it may not be a remedy. The evidence of the National Flood Insurance Program and federal wildfire response illustrates how politically difficult it may be to adjust programs to be more adaptive.","[Anderson, Sarah E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, 2400 Bren Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Anderson, Terry L.; Libecap, Gary D.] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hill, Alice C.] Hoover Inst, 1399 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Kahn, Matthew E.] Univ Southern Calif, Econ Dept, Spatial Sci & Environm Studies, NBER,IZA, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Kunreuther, Howard] Univ Penn, Decis Sci & Publ Policy, Wharton Sch, OID,Risk Management & Decis Proc Ctr, 3730 Walnut St,563 Huntsman Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Libecap, Gary D.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Econ Dept, NBER, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Mantripragada, Hari] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, 940 Benedum Hall,3700 OHara St, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Merel, Pierre] Univ Calif Davis, Davis Agr & Resource Econ, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Plantinga, Andrew J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, 3424 Bren Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Smith, V.

Urgent adaptive action often has to be taken on the basis of imperfect information, with the risk of maladaptive consequences. These issues of knowledge quality can be particularly acute in vulnerable developing countries like Bangladesh, where there can be less capacity for producing and using climate knowledge. This paper argues that climate change adaptation in places like Bangladesh would benefit from a more self-conscious critical review of the knowledge systems mobilised in support of action, and suggests that 'knowledge quality assessment' (KQA) tools can structure this review. It presents a desktop assessment of information used for climate change adaptation projects in Sylhet Division in Bangladesh, steered by the six themes of the 'Guidance for Uncertainty Assessment and Communication' KQA tool. The assessment found important differences in approaches to mobilising knowledge, particularly between governmental and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). It demonstrated that problem framing has an impact on project success; projects that adopt a narrow techno-scientific framing can lead to significant adverse side effects. Recognising this some projects are engaging stakeholders in framing adaptation. It found a lack of national policy Guidance on the use of indicators or appraisal of uncertainty, seeing government agencies fall back on their risk-based calculations, and NGOs attempt to identify indicators and uncertainties via community engagement, with mixed success. Moreover, the adaptation knowledge base is relatively disintegrated, despite tentative steps toward its consolidation and appraisal, potentially related to on-going friction impeding vertical communication within government, and horizontal communication between government, NGOs and stakeholders. This all suggests that the Bangladeshi practices at the adaptation science-policy interface can benefit from reflection on KQA criteria; reflection that could concretely be encouraged through revision of the national policy framework.

Using a descriptive-qualitative research design, this study analysed the vernacular houses of the Ibanag, Itawit, and Malaweg in the province of Cagayan in the Philippines to derive a practical template for designing sustainable and climate-conscious houses and buildings. Using focus group discussions (FGD) and observations cross referencing it to concretised architectural and cultural sources revealed that the vernacular houses, particularly that of the Ibanag and Itawit, possess similar characteristics to the typical Filipino bahaykubo, however, distinguished with a separate kitchen bridged by a balag or binattag. It is elevated from the ground to keep the floor dry and to protect their belongings when the Cagayan River swells. The walling and windows of awning or sliding type made of bamboo practically makes the house penetrable providing natural ventilation and lighting. The gannung or tallung(silong in Tagalog) allows air to flow from below through the bamboo permeable floors. There is absence of ceilings or room divisions in the house that allows free circulation of air during the hot seasons. Moreover, materials like cogon, bamboo, uwav (rattan), and local woods which are endemic in the locality were used in its construction. Ultimately, close community ties and the bayanihan spirit in the community are vital mechanisms for climate change adaptation. With the environmental challenges indigenous communities are facing today, the vernacular houses' architectural design features can inspire the houses and buildings of today.","[Mabborang, Ma Haidee; Maguddayao, Ruth N.; Udaundo, Leonora; Laggui, Narcisa; Martin, Engr Buencamino] Cagayan State Univ, Coll Engn & Architecture, Tuguegarao, Philippines; [Nozaleda, Bryan M.] Cagayan State Univ, Coll Human Kinet, Tuguegarao, Philippines; [Sibal, Corazon] Cagayan State Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Tuguegarao, Philippines",Cagayan State University; Cagayan State University; Cagayan State University,"Nozaleda, BM (corresponding author), Cagayan State Univ, Coll Human Kinet, Tuguegarao, Philippines.",bnozaleda@csu.edu.ph,,,Commission on Higher Education; National Commission for Culture and the Arts through the SALIKHA Creative Grants,Commission on Higher Education; National Commission for Culture and the Arts through the SALIKHA Creative Grants,"This research was supported by the Commission on Higher Education and the National Commission for Culture and the Arts through the SALIKHA Creative Grants.

We assess the potential effects of climate change on water resources and evaluate the ability of stakeholder prioritized adaptation options to address adaptation requirements using the Water Evaluation And Planning (WEAP) model. Two adaptation options, check dams and increasing forest cover, are prioritized using pair-wise comparison and scenario analysis. Future streamflow projections are generated for the mid-21st century period (2021-2050) using four high resolution (similar to 25 km) Regional Climate Models and their ensemble mean for SRES A1B scenario. WEAP simulations indicate that, compared to a base scenario without adaptation, both adaptation options reduce streamflow. In comparison to check dams, increasing forest cover shows greater ability to address adaptation requirements as demonstrated by the temporal pattern and magnitude of streamflow reduction. Additionally, over the 30 year period, effectiveness of check dams in reducing streamflow decreases by up to 40 %, while that of forest cover increases by up to 47 %. Our study highlights the merits of a comparative assessment of adaptation options and we conclude that a combined approach involving stakeholders, scenario analysis, modelling techniques and multi-model projections may support climate change adaptation decision-making in the face of uncertainty.","[Bhave, Ajay Gajanan; Mishra, Ashok; Raghuwanshi, Narendra Singh] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Agr & Food Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur,"Bhave, AG (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Agr & Food Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",ajaybhave84@gmail.com; amishra@agfe.iitkgp.ernet.in; nsr@agfe.iitkgp.ernet.in,"Raghuwanshi, Narendra/E-7321-2016",,HighNoon project; European Commission [227087],HighNoon project; European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"This work has been supported by the HighNoon project, funded by the European Commission Framework Programme 7 under Grant Nr. 227087.",,28,6,7,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

RAP combines, under a unified framework, elements from robust action, participatory planning and network theory to capture the different motives, perception, and roles of actors that are important for climate change adaptation. RAP leverages existing structures and networks and involves diverse actors to plan, sequence and time strategies across multiple levels (i.e. from local to national). Actors identify adaptation interventions and important actor relations to develop wide networks, highlighting potential pathways for connecting action from central policy to local implementation (and vice versa). Comparing these proposed participatory structures with existing structures reveals actors deemed important for delivering adaptation, as well as gaps and overlaps in their relations. The end result is a robust plan covering many perspectives and local realities for both relieving immediate and adapting to longer-term consequences of climate change. We applied the RAP framework in Ghana's agricultural climate change adaptation regime to demonstrate its usefulness as a means of planning adaptation interventions in a climate-vulnerable, multi-actor and multi-level setting. The application of the RAP framework in this paper highlights how it can: (1) visualise the adaptation space (and its different components), and reduce the complexity of implementing adaptation responses; (2) offer a shared space to actors from all administrative levels to think and create collective narratives for adaptation without demanding explicit consensus and; (3) identify key actors and actions through a collaborative planning process, and allocate responsibility for the smooth delivery of adaptation interventions.","[Chaudhury, Abrar S.; Thornton, Thomas F.; Helfgott, Ariella; Sova, Chase] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England; [Chaudhury, Abrar S.; Sova, Chase] CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Oxford; CGIAR,"Chaudhury, AS (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England.;Chaudhury, AS (corresponding author), CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Wageningen, Netherlands.",abrarchaudhury@gmail.com,"Thornton, Tom/AAJ-5105-2020","Thornton, Philip/0000-0002-1854-0182; Chaudhury, Abrar/0000-0002-3094-7639",CGIAR Fund; Environmental Change Institute (University of Oxford); Environment Institute (University of Adelaide),CGIAR Fund(CGIAR); Environmental Change Institute (University of Oxford); Environment Institute (University of Adelaide)(CGIAR),"This work was implemented as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements.

The influence of linear positivist models of science uptake are proving ineffective in a world with increasingly concentrated wealth and power, institutional barriers, and rapidly growing risks facing the many. A plurality of approaches is needed to better examine those dynamics of climate adaptation which are often invisible in models of science uptake - equity, the value of contestation, path dependency - and to consider how to empower communities to find solutions. In this conceptual paper, we argue that bridging existing positivist and interpretivist methods with insights from post-foundational theory so as to underpin pluralism and re-orient ethical principles of justice, strengthens the capacity of social research to support transformative climate adaptation.

The results show that both cities aim for an increased state-market-civil society interaction. However, their efforts have different points of departure and follow different trajectories. New York City's administration is within the Anglo-American tradition of state-market dualism, while the state-market-civil society interaction for adaptation is coordinated by newly created administrative organizations. This interaction has to be accommodated to the strong reliance on market mechanisms. Helsinki's administration has its roots in the welfare state administration with a strong role of the public administration. Increased state-market-civil society interaction results in a reduced influence of the public sector and the reliance on ad hoc projects and informal modes of cross-sectoral cooperation.","[Klein, Johannes] Geol Survey Finland, Espoo, Finland; [Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Ecol & Environm Res Programme, Urban Environm Policy, Helsinki, Finland; [Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci HELSUS, Helsinki, Finland",Geological Survey of Finland (GTK); University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Klein, J (corresponding author), Geol Survey Finland, Espoo, Finland.",,"Juhola, Sirkku/GVS-5485-2022","Klein, Johannes/0000-0003-0721-4063; Juhola, Sirkku/0000-0003-0095-2282",Norden Top-level Research Initiative; COST Action [IS1309],Norden Top-level Research Initiative; COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),"The preparation of this publication has been supported by the Norden Top-level Research Initiative subprogram Effect Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change through the Nordic Centre of Excellence for Strategic Adaptation Research (NORD-STAR) and COST Action IS1309 Innovations in Climate Governance: Sources, Patterns and Effects (INOGOV).

An exploratory sequential mixed method design was used, allowing the utilisation of both qualitative and quantitative methods in a single study. A total of 50 farmers (25 farmers from each group) were identified through purposive homogeneous sampling and were given a questionnaire consisting of semi-structured and structured questions. The study established that some of the most prominent factors constraining adaptation amongst farmers in the Local Municipality are related to their physical environment, lack of market access, financial constraints and limited access to established social networks (such as farmers associations).

However, the translation of policy into effective actions that transform territories faces barriers, and is proving to be a true challenge. Through the findings of 2 years of field research (ABSTRACT-colurba project), based on the study of ten French local authorities, this paper discusses the main barriers that decision-makers are confronted with, and the drivers by which they may succeed or which could trigger more efficient actions at the local level. Once again, this study confirms that barriers are mainly reported at the resource, governance, and awareness levels. Thus, the reduction of subsidies from national government, the priority given to economic criteria and the lack of awareness of climate issues are among the main barriers. Potential and successful drivers are mainly reported at the organisational level. Indeed, the necessity to reorganise the way local public institutions are working to implement climate policy is highlighted as an important lever to overcome certain obstacles. We conclude that research on barriers and drivers to climate change adaptation is essential to better understand why efforts are so slow to take into consideration the obvious acceleration of the manifestations of climate change. But we also recommend focusing on the human factors involved into the decision-making processes, at the collective (organisational) as well as the individual (perception) level, to better relate the findings to stakeholders and to find ways to integrate them into action-research projects in order to accelerate an urgent transformation of urban systems into sustainable systems.","[Simonet, Guillaume] Univ Toulouse Jean Jaures, LISST, UMR 5193, 5 Allees Machado, F-31058 Toulouse, France; [Leseur, Alexia] Inst Climate Econ I4CE, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite de Toulouse - Jean Jaures,"Simonet, G (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse Jean Jaures, LISST, UMR 5193, 5 Allees Machado, F-31058 Toulouse, France.",simonet.guillaume@ymail.com; alexia.leseur@laposte.net,,,,,,,73,11,11,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Although mangroves themselves are sensitive to climate change, they also provide services that would help reduce damages, by sequestering carbon, enhancing coastline stability, and protecting coastal settlements from tropical storm surges. In particular, mangroves can rapidly colonize and stabilize intertidal sediments, promoting coastal accretion to reduce the impact of sea level rise. The Government of Bangladesh has established mangrove plantations with the intent to accelerate accretion and stabilize 120,000ha of coastland. As a case study, this paper uses GIS data on coastal dynamics and land cover to evaluate the effectiveness of mangrove plantations for facilitating accretion and preventing erosion in Bangladesh. The results indicate that plantation areas experience greater rates of accretion relative to erosion than non-plantation areas, confirming that mangroves have an important role to play in the sustainable development of coastal regions.","[Chow, Jeffrey] Int Ctr Climate Change & Dev, Dhaka, Bangladesh",,"Chow, J (corresponding author), 8 Princess Margaret Rd 6F, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jchow.conservation@gmail.com,,,Fulbright-Clinton Fellowship; United States Department of State; United States Environmental Protection Agency Science [FP917398]; Yale University Tropical Resources Institute; Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies,Fulbright-Clinton Fellowship; United States Department of State; United States Environmental Protection Agency Science(United States Environmental Protection Agency); Yale University Tropical Resources Institute; Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies,"This research has been supported by the Fulbright-Clinton Fellowship, the United States Department of State, the United States Environmental Protection Agency Science to Achieve Results Graduate Fellowship (Grant Number: FP917398), the Yale University Tropical Resources Institute, and the Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies.",,84,34,35,9,77,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1054-9811,1540-756X,,J SUSTAIN FOREST,J.

Agri-food GIs are deeply grounded on the concept of terroir, whose key aspects can be altered by climate change. In this context, understanding whether and how agents involved in agri-food GIs production are adapting to climate change is a crucial issue, together with pointing out the role played by either economic incentives or subsidies in the implementation of adaptation measures. To answer these questions, this research focuses on the case of the agri-food sector of the Veneto Region. First, a subsample of agri-food GIs is identified. Second, a mixed-methods approach is implemented, including 14 semi-structured in-depth interviews with key informants and two focus group discussions to analyze the effects related to climate change and the implementation of adaptation measures. Different levels of concern regarding the effects of climate change are observed. Similarly, the implementation of adaptation measures largely varies in relation to the type of GI (e.g., animal-based or crop-based), crop system (annual or permanent crops) and altitude of the production areas (e.g., mountains or plain). Additionally, several groups of barriers to adaptation are outlined, including behavioral, socioeconomic, policy- and governance-related, informative and structural ones. Several recommendations are suggested: de jure recognition of the current functions of some Consortia and Producers Organizations, scaling up adaptation strategies beyond the GI system through cooperation and institutionalized networks and developing knowledge provision systems based on participatory approaches.","[Salpina, Dana; Pagliacci, Francesco] Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy",University of Padua,"Salpina, D (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy.",dana.salpina@unipd.it,,"PAGLIACCI, Francesco/0000-0002-3667-7115; Salpina, Dana/0000-0001-9663-2456","Department of Land, Environment, Agriculture and Forestry, Universita degli Studi di Padova [PAGL_BIRD20_05-BIRD 3 2020/2022]","Department of Land, Environment, Agriculture and Forestry, Universita degli Studi di Padova","This research was funded by the Department of Land, Environment, Agriculture and Forestry, Universita degli Studi di Padova, grant number PAGL_BIRD20_05-BIRD 3 2020/2022.",,60,1,1,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2022,14,18,,,,,,,11482,10.3390/su141811482,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141811482,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,4R8WX,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000857038100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet often the adaptation responses proposed belie complex political realities, particularly in politically unstable contexts, where power and politics shape adaptation outcomes. In this paper, the concepts of authority and recognition are used to capture power and politics as they play out in struggles over governing changing resources. The case study in Nepal shows how adaptation policy formation and implementation becomes a platform in which actors seek to claim authority and assert more generic rights as political and cultural citizens. Focusing on authority and recognition helps illuminate how resource governance struggles often have very little to do with the resources themselves. Foundational to the argument is how projects which seek to empower actors to manage their resources, produce realignments of power and knowledge that then shape who is invested in what manner in adaptation. The analysis adds to calls for reframing 'adaptation' to encompass the socionatural processes that shape vulnerability by contributing theoretical depth to questions of power and politics.","[Nightingale, Andrea J.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, Ulls Vag 28,POB 7012, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Nightingale, Andrea J.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragric, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Nightingale, AJ (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, Ulls Vag 28,POB 7012, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",andrea.nightingale@slu.se,,,Royal Society of Edinburgh International Exchange Award; British Academy International Partnership and Mobility Award,Royal Society of Edinburgh International Exchange Award; British Academy International Partnership and Mobility Award,"This paper has been significantly improved by critical comments from Neera Singh, Hemant Ojha, Adam Pain, Tulasi Sigdel, Bharat Pokarel, Sarah Byrne, Anil Bhatterai, the editors of Geoforum and an anonymous reviewer.

The goal of this work was to explore whether or not the intention of engaging could be understood (Study 1) and promoted (Study 2), by using an extension of the theory of planned behaviour. In Study 1, stakeholders from three European Mediterranean case studies were surveyed: Baixo Vouga Lagunar (Portugal), SCOT Provence Mediterranee (France), and the island of Crete (Greece) (N = 115). Stakeholders' intention of engaging was significantly predicted by subjective norm (which was predicted by injunctive normative beliefs towards policy-makers and stakeholders) and by perceived behavioural control (which was predicted by knowledge of policy and instruments). Study 2 was conducted in the Baixo Vouga Lagunar case study and consisted of a two-workshop intervention where issues on local and regional adaptation, policies, and engagement were presented and discussed. A within-participants comparison of initial survey results with results following the workshops (N-T1 = 12, N-T2 = 15, N-T3 = 12) indicated that these were successful in increasing stakeholders' intention of engaging. This increase was paired with a) an increase in injunctive normative beliefs towards policy-makers and consequently in subjective norm, and to b) a decrease in perceived complexity of planning local adaptation and an increase in knowledge regarding adaptation to climate change.","[Luis, Silvia; Lima, Maria Luisa] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, Ctr Invest & Intervencao Social CIS IUL, Lisbon, Portugal; [Roseta-Palma, Catarina] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, BRU IUL, Lisbon, Portugal; [Rodrigues, Nuno; Freitas, Fabiana; Lillebo, Ana, I] Univ Aveiro, CESAM, Dept Biol, Aveiro, Portugal; [Sousa, Lisa P.; Alves, Fatima L.] Univ Aveiro, Dept Ambiente & Ordenamento, CESAM, Aveiro, Portugal; [Parrod, Camille; Jolivet, Vincent] ACTeon Environm Consultancy, Colmar, France; [Paramana, Theodora; Poulos, Serafim] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Fac Geol & Geoenvironm, Athens, Greece; [Alexandrakis, George] Fdn Res & Technol, Inst Appl & Computat Math, Iraklion, Greece",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Luis, S (corresponding author), ISCTE Lisbon Univ Inst, Ctr Psychol Res & Social Intervent, Edf ISCTE IUL,Room 2W17,Av Forcas Armadas, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal.",silvia_luis@iscte-iul.pt,"Sousa, Lisa P/A-9696-2012; Freitas, Fabiana P./A-9405-2012; Lillebø, Ana I/C-3773-2009; Roseta-Palma, Catarina/B-5957-2009; Lima, M Luisa/E-5173-2010; Luis, Silvia/F-3445-2015","Sousa, Lisa P/0000-0001-8017-0971; Freitas, Fabiana P./0000-0003-0280-2181; Lillebø, Ana I/0000-0002-5228-0329; Roseta-Palma, Catarina/0000-0001-9332-823X; Lima, M Luisa/0000-0003-1171-2962; Rodrigues, Nuno/0000-0003-4223-3382; Luis, Silvia/0000-0002-2631-998X","European Commission [EU/FP7/ CIRCLE-MED Era Net Programme]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [CIRCLE-MED/0002/2013, CIRCLE-MED/0001/2013, PEst-OE/EGE/UI0315/2014, UID/AMB/50017/2013, SFRH/BD/79170/2011, SFRH/BD/78348/2011]; Mariolopoulos-Kanaginis Foundation for the Environmental Sciences (MKF); National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PEst-OE/EGE/UI0315/2014, SFRH/BD/79170/2011, SFRH/BD/78348/2011, CIRCLE-MED/0002/2013, UID/AMB/50017/2013, CIRCLE-MED/0001/2013] Funding Source: FCT",European Commission [EU/FP7/ CIRCLE-MED Era Net Programme]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Mariolopoulos-Kanaginis Foundation for the Environmental Sciences (MKF); National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia,"This work was supported by the European Commission [EU/FP7/ CIRCLE-MED Era Net Programme]; by the Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia through funding to the project (grant number CIRCLE-MED/0002/2013 and grant number CIRCLE-MED/0001/2013), to the Portuguese Institutions involved (grant number PEst-OE/EGE/UI0315/2014; UID/AMB/50017/2013), and through PhD grants to Lisa Sousa (grant number SFRH/BD/79170/2011) and Fabiana Freitas (grant number SFRH/BD/78348/2011).

However, as previous studies and day-to-day interactions with local leaders make clear, identifying ways to resource adaptation is one of the most significant barriers to progress. This paper draws on selected findings from a study that aimed to better describe the nature of the adaptation finance challenges local governments face so as to find ways to overcome them. Building on initial findings from an online survey and nine stakeholder workshops to deepen the understanding of the nature of funding and financing challenges for local governments, we use a methodological innovation in archetype analysis, grounded theory, to develop a suite of 15 archetypal adaptation finance challenges, i.e., repeatedly found patterns of interrelated causal factors, traits, and outcomes ranging from establishing a matter of concern worthy of attention (and funding) to acquiring, using, and managing adaptation finance. These archetypes are found across different types and sizes of local governments facing different climate change threats. The resulting deeper understanding of local adaptation funding challenges represents an important contribution to the literature and opens up new avenues for intervention beyond the prevailing focus on creating new funding vehicles. We offer archetype-specific recommendations to overcome or reduce these critical finance challenges in local climate change adaptation.","[Moser, Susanne C.] Susanne Moser Res & Consulting, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Moser, Susanne C.] Antioch Univ New England, Keene, NH 03431 USA; [Ekstrom, Julia A.] Calif Dept Water Resources, Climate Change Program, Sacramento, CA USA; [Ekstrom, Julia A.] Univ Calif Davis, Policy Inst Energy Environm & Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Kim, Julia] Local Govt Commiss, Sacramento, CA USA; [Heitsch, Samantha] ICF Int, Fairfax, VA USA",Antioch University New England; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Moser, SC (corresponding author), Susanne Moser Res & Consulting, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.;Moser, SC (corresponding author), Antioch Univ New England, Keene, NH 03431 USA.",,,,California Natural Resources Agency (CNRA); California Natural Resources Agency; USEPA [83519401]; EPA,California Natural Resources Agency (CNRA); California Natural Resources Agency; USEPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency); EPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"The research team would like to thank the California Natural Resources Agency (CNRA) for funding support for this project and Jamie Anderson, DWR, and Michael McCormick, Office of Planning and Research (OPR) for advice along the way.

As a result, they invariably look at the consequences but ignore the drivers of climate change. Since past approaches towards climate change adaptation have had limited success, the most effective and sustainable way to minimize future climate change impacts on humanity is through transformative adaptation (TA). This paper defines and characterizes the conceptual foundations of this term and outlines how TA influences current and future climate change adaptation challenges. This paper reviews the meaning and purpose of transformation in climate change adaptation and, by means of a set of case studies, explains how their commonalities can help define good TA practice. Deploying a range of situations, this study shows how this approach is being implemented in a set of countries, and considers its potential transformative impact, its benefits, and challenges. The results obtained have shown that when implemented with due care, TA can yield long-term benefits to local communities.

Ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change is the type of adaptation that aims to combine these outcomes and is particularly relevant to developing nations that safeguard most of the planetary biodiversity and healthy ecosystems. Although conceptually new, ecosystem-based adaptation is fastly gaining traction both as a research arena and as an integrated policy instrument. This paper aims to revisit this concept and to discuss the science and policy challenges faced by it. It argues that ecosystem-based adaptation is a policy mix that promotes adaptive transition, which is a step towards sustainability transitions. It faces two major challenges in promoting transitions towards adaptation and sustainability. First, research on ecosystem-based adaptation mostly takes place within the socio-ecological systems framework, which is often carried out in isolation from socio-technical systems research. It is widely recognized that both types of research should be integrated, for the benefit of science and policy-making, and the paper discusses the potential of ecosystem-based adaptation in providing such bridge. Second, there is a divide between global and local research and policy, while at local level this divide is related to the setting (e.g., coastal, urban, rural). The resulting mosaic of information lacks integration, which hinders scalability of actions and policies. Finally, I examine the opportunity for ecological and conservation scientists to interact with social, economic and political scientists on ecosystem-based adaptation research, and discuss how timely this opportunity is for Brazil.

CRA refers to participatory methods to assess hazards, vulnerabilities and capacities in support of community-based disaster risk reduction, used by many NGOs, community-based organizations, and the Red Cross/Red Crescent. We review the evolution of climate change adaptation and community-based disaster risk reduction, and highlight the challenges of integrating global climate change into a bottom-up and place-based approach. Our analysis of CRAs carried out by various national Red Cross societies shows that CRAs can help address those challenges by fostering community engagement in climate risk reduction, particularly given that many strategies to deal with current climate risks also help to reduce vulnerability to climate change. Climate change can also be explicitly incorporated in CRAs by making better use of CRA tools to assess trends, and by addressing the notion of changing risks. However, a key challenge is to keep CRAs simple enough for wide application. This demands special attention in the modification of CRA tools; in the background materials and trainings for CRA facilitators; and in the guidance for interpretation of CRA outcomes. A second challenge is the application of a limited set of CRA results to guide risk reduction in other communities and to inform national and international adaptation policy. This requires specific attention for sampling and care in scaling up qualitative findings. Finally, stronger linkages are needed between organizations facilitating CRAs and suppliers of climate information, particularly addressing the translation of climate information to the community level.

Urban areas, which concentrate population, economic activity and infrastructures, ar e sometimes at high-risk locations. Yet they are to be considered as vulnerable systems in need of harmonized structures supporting their efforts towards mitigating climate effects and/or adapting their territories to them. One current structure is the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Ener g y (CoM) initiative, tackling in a global and harmonized way local adaptation to climate change. Do CoM cities that developed acceptable climate change adaptation plans have similar characteristics? It is sti l l unclear which might be the drivers or key attributes potentially leading to successf u l planning within the initiative. In this paper, we explore attributes of the first 51 cities that have submitted their adaptation plans to CoM, in order to identi f y common elements among accepted plans. Therefore, our hypothesis is that there must be attributes determining the acceptance of adaptation plans. In order to do so, the cities were classified as compliant and non-compliant with the CoM principles. Fisher's and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were applied to identi f y attributes that are statistically different between both groups. Results show that the engagement of multiple stakeholders and citizens, particularly at the local level , might significantly facilitate the acceptance of adaptation plans in the initiative. We also found that the benefits of stakeholder and citizen engagement could be greater in sma l l municipalities because citizens and stakeholders have more opportunities to participate.","[Rivas, Silvia; Hernandez, Yeray; Urraca, Ruben; Barbosa, Paulo] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Via Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy; [Urraca, Ruben] Univ La Rioja, Dept Mech Engn, Logrono 26004, La Rioja, Spain",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; Universidad de La Rioja,"Rivas, S (corresponding author), European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Via Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy.",silvia.rivas-calvete@ec.europa.eu,"Urraca, Ruben/I-3256-2015","Urraca, Ruben/0000-0003-0453-1143",Plan Propio de la Universidad de La Rioja; V Plan Riojano de I+D,Plan Propio de la Universidad de La Rioja; V Plan Riojano de I+D,"The views expressed here are purely those of the authors and may not, under any circumstances, be regarded as an official position of the European Commission.

While climate change exacerbates the vulnerability of pastoralists, this remains largely unaccounted for in current Nigerian and Ghanaian pastoral livestock policy. Employing a thematic analytical approach, the article assesses the representation of pastoralists within climate change adaptation strategies in Ghana and Nigeria, and the impact of this on their livelihoods. Our findings indicate that pastoralists are poorly represented in current policy, which is inclined towards transitions to intensive sedentary systems. This risks enhancing the vulnerability of pastoralists to climate impacts by constraining mobility. We conclude that improved clarity on how these policies account for climate change in transitioning pastoral systems into intensive sedentary systems could encourage compliance and buy-in by pastoralists and farmers. It is recommended that future livestock policies address climate change and bolster producer mobility to better support the livelihoods of pastoralists.","[Tinsley, Jonathan H.

Here, we discuss participatory action-research (PAR) as a way of thinking and leading investigations that may promote incremental and transformative changes in the context of climate change adaptation research. Our exploration is addressed in the Portuguese context, where PAR and sustainable transition studies are still marginal, and adaptation processes are a recent topic on political agendas. We describe the characteristics of PAR and use two studies of adaptation to illustrate how research and practice co-evolve through interactive cycles. The two studies are works in progress, rather than completed PAR processes. Climate change adaptation is an ongoing and long-term process. Moreover, in Portugal, as in many regions of the world, climate change adaptation is a fairly new topic. Thus, both case studies are now initiating a long-term process of change and adaptation. The completion of one research cycle is a realistic expectation that we have achieved in the two case study experiences. In our discussion of the case studies, we consider how these experiences provide insights into the role of PAR for long-term regime changes. We conclude by pointing to the societal needs addressed by PAR, as a pragmatically oriented and context-specific research design. The approach can be complementary to other frameworks in sustainable transition studies such as transition management. Being more pragmatically oriented, PAR cycles may influence incrementally transformative changes that can be guided by transition management's long-term design for governing sustainable transitions.","[Campos, Ines S.; Alves, Filipe M.; Vizinho, Andre; Penha-Lopes, Gil] Univ Lisbon, CE3C, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal; [Dinis, Joao] Cascais Municipal, Cascais, Portugal; [Truninger, Monica] Univ Lisbon, Inst Social Sci, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal","Universidade de Lisboa; Institute of Social Sciences, University of Lisbon (ICS-UL); Universidade de Lisboa","Campos, IS (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, CE3C, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal.",,"Campos, Ines/AAK-5822-2021; Penha-Lopes, Gil/N-1475-2015; Truninger, Mónica/H-6152-2019","Penha-Lopes, Gil/0000-0002-1024-1954; Truninger, Monica/0000-0002-4251-2261; Campos, Ines/0000-0001-5677-875X; Moreira Alves, Filipe/0000-0003-2749-826X; Vizinho, Andre/0000-0002-0503-3624",FCT [UID/BIA/00329/2013]; FP7 project BASE [308337]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [SFRH/BPD/65977/2009]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BPD/65977/2009] Funding Source: FCT,FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FP7 project BASE; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia,"The funding for publishing the article was granted under FCT Ref.

In the face of uncertainty, decision-making can be addressed in two interdependent stages: make only partial ex ante anticipative actions to keep options open until new information is revealed, and adapt the first-stage decisions with respect to newly acquired information. This decision-making approach corresponds to the two-stage stochastic optimization (STO) incorporating both anticipative ex ante and adaptive ex post decisions within a single model. This paper develops a two-stage STO model for climate change adaptation through robust land use and irrigation planning under conditions of uncertain water supply. The model identifies the differences between decision-making in the cases of perfect information, full uncertainty, and two-stage STO from the perspective of learning about uncertainty. Two-stage anticipative and adaptive decision-making with safety constraints provides risk-informed decisions characterized by quantile-based Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at-Risk risk measures. The ratio between the ex ante and ex post costs and the shape of uncertainty determine the balance between the anticipative and adaptive decisions. Selected numerical results illustrate that the alteration of the ex ante agricultural production costs can affect crop production, management technologies, and natural resource utilization.","[Ermolieva, Tatiana; Havlik, Petr; Frank, Stefan; Kahil, Taher; Balkovic, Juraj; Skalsky, Rastislav; Ermoliev, Yuri] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Knopov, Pavel S.; Gorbachuk, Vasyl M.] Inst Cybernet, UA-03187 Kiev, Ukraine; [Borodina, Olena M.] Inst Econ & Forecasting, UA-01011 Kiev, Ukraine","International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; V.

Many CPPs rely on large amounts of water, which makes them vulnerable to climate change. Through the theoretical modeling and case study, the paper investigated the climate change adaptation strategies of CPPs from both short-run and long-run perspectives. In the short-run, the role of increasing cooling water intake to adapt to the adverse climate conditions is limited by local water supply capacity, environmental regulations, and existing technology. In the long-run, the CPP operator's adaptation retrofitting decisions are affected by multiple factors including the expected impacts of climate change, remaining lifespan, initial retrofit cost, and interest rate. But climate change information may not make difference to CPP operators' adaptation decisions in some circumstances. No matter adaptation retrofit can bring additional benefits, the government's incentive policies can induce the CPP operator to invest in adaptation retrofit no later than when the impacts of climate change appear. The incentive policies' ability to promote adaptation strategies to break through the profit threshold is the key to achieve the government's expected adaptation strategies.","[Wei, Pengbang] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Management, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Peng, Yufang] Henan Univ Econ & Law, HuangHe Business Sch, Zhengzhou 450011, Peoples R China; [Chen, Weidong] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Zhengzhou University; Henan University of Economics & Law; Tianjin University,"Peng, YF (corresponding author), Henan Univ Econ & Law, HuangHe Business Sch, Zhengzhou 450011, Peoples R China.",pengyufang_222@163.com,,,,,,,46,0,0,15,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Understanding how the rice production system has historically responded to external forces, both natural and anthropogenic, will provide critical insights into how the system is likely to respond in the future. The observed historic rice movement provides insights into the capability of the rice production system to adapt to climate changes. Using province-level rice production data and historic climate records, here we show that the centroid of Chinese rice production shifted northeastward over 370km (2.98 degrees N in latitude and 1.88 degrees E in longitude) from 1949 to 2010. Using a linear regression model, we examined the driving factors, in particular climate, behind such rice production movement. While the major driving forces of the rice relocation are such social economic factors as urbanization, irrigation investment, and agricultural or land use policy changes, climate plays a significant role as well. We found that temperature has been a significant and coherent influence on moving the rice center in China and precipitation has had a significant but less spatially coherent influence.","[Li, Zhengguo; Yang, Peng; Wu, Wenbin; Tang, Huajun; You, Liangzhi] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Key Lab Agriinformat, Minist Agr, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhenhuan] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Dept Land Resources & Environm Studies, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Anderson, Weston; You, Liangzhi] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning, CAAS; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Sun Yat Sen University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)","Tang, HJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Key Lab Agriinformat, Minist Agr, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",tanghuajun@caas.cn; l.you@cgiar.org,"Li, Zhengguo/AAR-5191-2020; Anderson, Weston/V-2616-2019; Liu, Yifan/S-6217-2017","Anderson, Weston/0000-0003-3755-9943; YANG, PENG/0000-0002-7999-9763","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41171328, 41201184, 41101170, 71228301]; Huazhong Agricultural University Scientific & Technological Self-innovation Foundation [2012RC002]; US National Science Foundation [AGS-1048967]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Huazhong Agricultural University Scientific & Technological Self-innovation Foundation; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The research presented here was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41171328, 41201184, and 41101170), Huazhong Agricultural University Scientific & Technological Self-innovation Foundation (Program No.2012RC002, National Natural Science Foundation of China (Award No. 71228301), and the US National Science Foundation (AGS-1048967).

This knowledge is underpinned by a set of standardised rules of thumb (heuristics) that define what climate adaptation is and what it means. For example, it is widely accepted that adaptation is a local issue that is best achieved by urgent anticipatory action by using participatory processes. Yet, the validity and relevance of these heuristics have rarely been tested or questioned. If these heuristics are not based on sound empirical evidence, their inclusion and use in scientific studies, policy development, planning and implementation processes can generate inappropriate solutions for highly complex problems. This research critically examines and tests a set of common climate adaptation heuristics and investigates the extent to which they correspond to with the lived experiences of practitioners who are engaged in climate adaptation planning in Queensland, Australia. The findings provide new insights into the applicability of adaptation heuristics, and point to several new rules of thumb that underpin climate adaptation in practice. For example, adaptation was mainly seen as a regional/transboundary issue with broader stakeholder involvement that is best pursued through an incremental `learn-as-we-go' approach. Retaining flexibility in the policy- and decision-making systems was preferred as were no-regret, value- and risk-based approaches. Future research is needed to explore further the different types of heuristics and how these best support adaptation science, policy, planning and decision-making processes.","[Nalau, Johanna; Torabi, Elnaz; Howes, Michael; Morgan, Ed] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Adaptat Sci Res Grp, Southport, Qld, Australia; [Nalau, Johanna; Torabi, Elnaz; Howes, Michael; Morgan, Ed] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Southport, Qld, Australia; [Edwards, Naomi] Griffith Ctr Social & Cultural Res, Sch Humanities Languages & Social Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University,"Nalau, J (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Adaptat Sci Res Grp, Southport, Qld, Australia.;Nalau, J (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Southport, Qld, Australia.",j.nalau@griffith.edu.au,"Nalau, Johanna/V-5692-2018","Nalau, Johanna/0000-0001-6581-3967",Australian Research Council [DE190100940]; Australian Research Council [DE190100940] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This research has been funded by the Australian Research Council's Discovery Early Career Research Award (DE190100940) Reevaluating climate adaptation principles for a more resilient Australia held by Dr Nalau.

Though experimental interventions that seek to engage communities have been implemented in a number of regions, most of these interventions stall after the experimental stage. This research utilised opportunities provided by a landmark intervention on Special Area Management in Negombo, Sri Lanka, to draw lessons for community-based interventions for climate change adaptation. Short term policy interventions can lead to irrevocable changes within complex socio-ecological systems, disintegrating identities and functions. Such systems become artificial, empty shells, losing their former richness and serenity. Tight social networks and bonds, which prevailed through centuries disappear, taking away the ability of communities to engage in collective action that allowed sustainable use of their common resource base. The resulting degradation of the natural resource base that form the livelihood of communities leads to further breaking down of the social network, driving this vicious cycle. It is clear that the Special Area Management (SAM) intervention in Negombo, Sri Lanka needs further improvement if it were to further the adaptive co-management approach, though the project that funded the intervention clearly expected to utilise this approach. The current national and provincial level institutional set up is not conducive for effective adaptive co-management. This is mainly due to conventional institutions adhering to governance regimes that are rigid and inflexible, and as such are not prepared to be adaptive through policy learning. It is also due to the fact that existing systems are not serious about community empowerment in the governance process. It is clear that any breakthrough allowing for an adaptive co-management kind of approach needs policy and institutional change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This article shows how leadership can be usefully conceptualized and operationalized within regional governance networks dealing with climate adaptation. It applies an integrative framework inspired by complexity leadership theory, distinguishing several leadership functions to enhance the adaptive capacity of regional networks. We focus on one specific institutional innovation, appointed climate adaptation officers, who seek to connect science and governance practice, and to mainstream climate adaptation. Our question is twofold: What is the potential of climate adaptation officers to advance the adaptation agenda and to what extent did their establishment and working practice mirror the various leadership functions needed to raise the adaptive capacity of the regional network they operated in? The integrative leadership framework structures the analysis of climate adaptation officers forming part of a government-funded project seeking to enhance adaptation to climate variability in the central German region of Northern Hesse. The data consist of interviews with scientists and regional authority employees and project documentation including an evaluation. We find that climate adaptation officers raised awareness for climate adaptation and helped to shape and implement a number of projects within the overall KLIMZUG programme, highlighting impeding and enabling factors. The process of setting up this institutional innovation involved all forms of leadership functions and is an example of vertical mainstreaming. Its operation involved most clearly enabling and connective leadership functions and is an example of horizontal mainstreaming.","[Stiller, Sabina; Meijerink, Sander] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Stiller, S (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.",s.stiller@fm.ru.nl; S.Meijerink@fm.ru.nl,"Meijerink, Sander V/D-6490-2012","Meijerink, Sander V/0000-0002-4249-6230",,,,,34,8,8,2,19,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

The study involved interviews and interaction with a wide range of relevant stakeholders, in order to map their perceptions on the effectiveness of CAP. The findings show that the CAP process and implementation provided for recognition of the role of local communities in climate change adaptation, and ensured their participation and leadership in the planning process. However, due to issues related to the local structure and governance of community-based organizations, the benefits of climate change adaptation support were enjoyed mostly by elites and powerful individuals. The paper suggests that more inclusive approaches are needed, so as to ensure the planning and governance of local institutions is more accountable and responsive to vulnerable households. This could be achieved by devolving decision-making power to the vulnerable households and ensuring inclusive provisions in membership, representation and resource allocation that encourage more equitable sharing of benefits.","[Regmi, Bimal Raj] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Regmi, Bimal Raj; Star, Cassandra] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Social & Policy Studies, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Leal Filho, Walter] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Manchester, Lancs, England",Flinders University South Australia; Manchester Metropolitan University,"Leal, W (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Manchester, Lancs, England.",bimal.regmi@icimod.org; Cassandra.star@flinders.edu.au; walter.leal@haw-hamburg.de,"Leal, Walter/ACX-9082-2022; Leal, Walter/AAU-6997-2021","Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Star, Cassandra/0000-0003-2648-6603",,,,,51,18,18,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Academic literature and recent international policy documents suggest potentials of conceptually and practically linking the fields of climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR) and emphasize the need to mitigate climate-related risks at local level. However, there is limited knowledge on how this link is established at local levels and the role of ground-level actors and practices therein. Using the case of recurrent and disastrous floods, this paper discusses the significance of linking DRR and CCA in Mumbai. It analyses policies, plans, institutions and interventions related to DRR and CCA and uses interviews and a field study to assess flood risk governance at the level of municipal wards and neighbourhoods. The findings suggest that although flood risk governance has been significantly strengthened, three gaps exist: First, a lack of a comprehensive plan for Mumbai that anticipates future risks and vulnerabilities and integrates CCA and DRR down to local level. Second, a lack of an overarching and decentralized institutional framework across sectors and scales that recognizes the multiplicity of formal and informal actors. Third, the potential of civil society and informal actors for disaster risk management and adaptation planning has not been tapped into sufficiently. The paper argues that potential exists to reconceptualize flood risk governance in Mumbai by focusing on future risks and vulnerabilities and by recognizing the work of informal actors like emergent groups at local level.","[Zimmermann, Theresa] Free Univ Berlin, Disaster Res Unit, Berlin, Germany; [Shinde, Swati; Parthasarathy, D.] Indian Inst Technol Bombay IITB, Interdisciplinary Programme Climate Studies, Mumbai, India; [Narayanan, N.

Nevertheless, a wider uptake of such solutions in urban areas faces different challenges and barriers. A comprehensive mapping of available NBS impact assessment methods could help to accelerate this process. There is, however, a lack of comprehensive systematization of economic analysis. This research aims to provide an overview of NBS impact evaluations by assessing how the scientific literature integrates such economic analysis into urban planning adaptation. A systematic review approach has been used to discuss the role of NBS in climate change adaptation. This review presents two main stages. Firstly, it identifies the biophysical-economic assessment of NBS adaptation measures to reduce urban flood extremes in coastal cities. Secondly, the NBS approaches were categorized based on the biophysical benefits (in terms of flood-risk reduction) related to each specific solution and the subsequent economic evaluation of such implementations. This research review revealed a low-level gap of integration between climate change issues and NBS analysis (i.e., it is commonly used as background condition). Most publications provide NBS biophysical impacts assessment, without combining these results with economic evaluation of the flood damages to finally achieve the avoided cost due to the implementation of such solutions. This work shows the growing interest on further research to develop spatially integrated environmental-economic assessment of NBS implementation, by highlighting the needs and opportunities of a trans-disciplinary approach to support policy-making in the framework of urban climate change adaptation.","[Quagliolo, Carlotta; Pezzoli, Alessandro] Politecn Torino, DIST Interuniv Dept Reg & Urban Studies & Plannin, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Quagliolo, Carlotta; Pezzoli, Alessandro] Univ Torino, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Roebeling, Peter; Mendonca, Rita] Univ Aveiro, Ctr Environm & Marine Studies CESAM, Dept Environm & Planning DAO, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Roebeling, Peter] Wageningen Univ & Res WUR, Wageningen Econ Res, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Comino, Elena] Politecn Torino, DIATI Dept Environm Land & Infrastruct Engn, I-10129 Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin; University of Turin; Universidade de Aveiro; Wageningen University & Research; Polytechnic University of Turin,"Quagliolo, C (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, DIST Interuniv Dept Reg & Urban Studies & Plannin, I-10125 Turin, Italy.;Quagliolo, C (corresponding author), Univ Torino, I-10125 Turin, Italy.",carlotta.quagliolo@polito.it,"; Roebeling, Peter/G-6233-2011","QUAGLIOLO, Carlotta/0000-0002-2798-4527; Comino, Elena/0000-0002-3289-1800; Roebeling, Peter/0000-0002-2421-9299",Politecnico di Torino,Politecnico di Torino,This research received funding from Politecnico di Torino.,,103,1,1,11,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2413-8851,,URBAN SCI,Urban Sci.,SEP,2022,6,3,,,,,,,53,10.3390/urbansci6030053,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/urbansci6030053,,,23,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,4U5NP,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000858840600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While existing studies attempted to create an exhaustive list of barriers by focusing on what is occurring, we continue to have a meager understanding of how or why barriers emerge in the governance process. Selecting Bangladesh as a case study area, we identify the mechanisms that cause the emergence of barriers in the climate change adaptation governance process. We particularly focus on the barriers that emerge through interactions among actors. We base our research on data from key-informant interviews and a systematic literature review. Our analysis reveals that there are at least five mechanisms that are involved in the emergence of barriers: enclosure and exclusion, boundary control, organizational inertia, belief formation, and frame polarization. Our identification of common mechanisms provides insights on actors' roles and activities in adaptation governance and elucidates the processes through which actors' interactions lead to barriers. This mechanism-based analysis of barriers will help to address and navigate through the barriers more effectively to ensure successful adaptation. As climate change is becoming mainstreamed in development plans and policies in our study area, identifying the mechanisms of adaptation barriers can elucidate how development and climate adaptation strategies are affected by identified barriers.","[Ishtiaque, Asif] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Dana 3575,440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Ishtiaque, Asif] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ USA; [Stock, Ryan] Northern Michigan Univ, Dept Earth Environm & Geog Sci, Marquette, MI 49855 USA; [Vij, Sumit] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Vij, Sumit] Vrije Univ, Fac Sci Earth & Climate, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Eakin, Hallie] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ USA; [Chhetri, Netra] Arizona State Univ, Sch Future Innovat Soc, Tempe, AZ USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Northern Michigan University; Wageningen University & Research; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Ishtiaque, A (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Dana 3575,440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",asif.ishtiaque@asu.edu,"Vij, Sumit/AAV-6617-2021","Eakin, Hallie/0000-0001-8253-1320; Ishtiaque, Asif/0000-0002-2196-9764; Stock, Ryan J./0000-0002-6218-3725; Chhetri, Netra/0000-0002-6341-8717",Arizona State University,Arizona State University,"This research is funded by the Matthew G.

As climate change impacts vary with locality, local adaption is important; however there are few processes that build awareness and engagement of householders with climate adaptation and planning. Using reports of discussions from 96 groups convened as part of a climate change engagement program called Energymark; this paper explores the concerns of householders around climate change and provides a lay perspective on climate adaptation. Analyses of group discussions reveal that householders were unable to readily distinguish between climate adaptation and mitigation actions. Groups discussed how they could increase local adaptive capacity through active citizenship and community action. This applied research provides empirical evidence of how deliberation can build social capital and contribute to local adaptive solutions. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Changing climate patterns will also make many locations inhospitable to the crops currently grown there. In order to mitigate the effects of climate change on agriculture, farmers should adapt by changing the mix of crops grown in a given location. Federal crop insurance masks incentives American farmers would otherwise have to adapt to climate change through crop choice. Large premium subsidies-with most insured farmers paying less than half of the actuarially sound premium-are a huge part of this problem. This Note explains the connection between crop choice and climate change. It then analyzes existing proposals for reforming the crop insurance system to better incentivize adaptation to climate change, and highlights some political and practical obstacles to doing so. Finally, it argues that a tiered subsidy system-in which crops at high risk of failure due to location-specific climate risks would receive lower subsidies-could be a feasible, incremental solution to the problem.","[Jaworski, Ann] New York Univ, Sch Law, New York, NY USA",New York University,"Jaworski, A (corresponding author), New York Univ, Sch Law, New York, NY USA.",,,,,,,,74,2,2,0,10,NEW YORK UNIV SCHOOL LAW,NEW YORK,"110 WEST THIRD ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",0028-7881,,,NEW YORK U LAW REV,N.

Africa faces significant challenges to water resources management in the form of high variability and regional scarcity, set within the context of generally weak institutional capacity. Management is further challenged by the transboundary nature of many of its river basins. Climate change, despite uncertainty about the detail of its impacts on water resources, is likely to exacerbate many of these challenges. River basins, and the riparian states that share them, differ in their capacities to adapt. Without appropriate cooperation adaptation may be limited and uneven. Further research to examine the factors and processes that are important for cooperation to lead to positive adaptation Outcomes and the increased adaptive capacity of water management institutions is suggested.","[Goulden, Marisa; Conway, Declan] Univ E Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Goulden, Marisa; Conway, Declan; Persechino, Aurelie] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Persechino, Aurelie] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England",University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia; NERC National Oceanography Centre; University of Southampton,"Goulden, M (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",m.goulden@uea.ac.uk,"Conway, Declan/HCH-7778-2022; persechino, Aurelie/A-3859-2012","Conway, Declan/0000-0002-4590-6733",Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research,Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research,"We thank the three reviewers for their useful comments and Tony Allan and Naho Mirumachi of Kings College, London and Mark Zeitoun of University of East Anglia for helpful discussions.

In this paper, we draw upon key insights from the institutional theories of organizations and research on public administration and climate adaptation in Sweden. We argue that potential organizational instabilities pose a substantial challenge for the mainstreaming of flexible approaches to climate adaptation. Given the unstable character of the relevant organizational landscape in a very stable country such as Sweden, it seems reasonable to also seriously doubt the capacity of the relevant authorities in less stable countries to carry out a great number of monitoring-intensive, and hence attention-demanding, adaptive governance processes over time.

Coping with an unstable climate warrants adjustments in regulations and new investments. The investment required to maintain a selected service level needs to balance the potential for high regret stranded assets with the political and socioeconomic consequences of not meeting water demands. In recent years, the City of Santiago in Chile has seen drought events associated with climate change, which could worsen in the future. Chile's drinking water regulatory framework does not account for uncertainty in infrastructure design to cope with the potential impacts of such events. This work presents an adaptation option design process that considers multiple plausible climate change-impacted future scenarios, accommodating both structural and nonstructural measures. In our Santiago case study adaptation measures include extensions to the existing Chilean water market and traditional structural alternatives (e.g., storage infrastructure); all are represented in a simulation model of the water utility. We evaluate and optimize packages of efficient adaptation measures for various climate scenarios. This allows comparing different portfolios of combined institutional and infrastructure interventions via a range of stakeholder measures and comparing their tradeoffs under different plausible climate-impacted hydrological scenarios. Results showed that water supply performance without climate change adaptation is worse under climate scenarios with lower water availability, which are likely to be associated with higher GHG emission scenarios such as RCP 8.5. The optimized portfolios implement various combinations of adaptation strategies to reduce the impacts of this poor performance. Considering the uncertainty on future climate scenarios, the use of nonstructural adaptation measures such as option contracts exhibits the advantage of providing water in critical periods while avoiding large investments such as building reservoirs or the purchase of permanent water rights, which could end up underused if favorable climate scenarios manifest.","[Ricalde, Inigo; Vicuna, Sebastian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile Vicuna Mackenna, Dept Hydraul & Environm Engn, Santiago 4860, Region Metropol, Chile; [Vicuna, Sebastian; Melo, Oscar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile Vicuna Mackenna, Ctr Cambio Global, Santiago 4860, Region Metropol, Chile; [Melo, Oscar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile Vicuna Mackenna, Dept Agr Econ, Santiago 4860, Region Metropol, Chile; [Tomlinson, James E.; Harou, Julien J.] Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Harou, Julien J.] UCL, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Characklis, Greg] Univ N Carolina, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 USA",University of Manchester; University of London; University College London; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Ricalde, I (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile Vicuna Mackenna, Dept Hydraul & Environm Engn, Santiago 4860, Region Metropol, Chile.",igricalde@uc.cl; svicuna@ing.puc.cl; omelo@uc.cl; james.tomlinson@manchester.ac.uk; julien.harou@manchester.ac.uk; charack@email.unc.edu,"Vicuna, Sebastian/M-2747-2016; melo, oscar/N-8872-2014","Vicuna, Sebastian/0000-0001-6971-0068; melo, oscar/0000-0002-9136-5413","Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo de Chile (ANID) [FONDECYT N1171133, N1211846]",Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo de Chile (ANID),"P We thank help from Cristian Chadwick, Pablo Merino and Angelo Oregon in the provision of climate and hydrologic time series, development of the simulation model and construction of adaptation strategies.

Northwest China has been detrimentally affected by the climatic variations due to its high exposure to extreme climatic events. A number of studies have reported agro-pastoralists' perceptions and adaptation responses to climate change, but the current knowledge of agro-pastoralists' perceptions of climate change in China are insufficient. To fill this research gap, this study aims to investigate the perception level of agro-pastoralists in Northwest China on climate change and related factors. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire based on household surveys of 554 study participants in four counties in Gansu Province, China. Raw data were collected using stratified random sampling. A probit model was used to analyze the respondents' understanding of climate change and its related socio-economic and demographic variables. Our results show that the majority of respondents were aware (70%) of the changes in temperature and precipitation. Socioeconomic and demographic variables such as gender, farming experience, education level, cultivated land size, agricultural income, livestock, village cadre experience, access to weather information of agro-pastoralists are pertinently related to agro-pastoralists' awareness of climate change. Farming experience, education level, household size, grassland size, agricultural income, association membership, village cadre experience has a high impact on agro-pastoralists' adaptation to climate change. The results of this study will help guide government agencies and decision makers, and help arid and semi-arid areas to build sustainable adaptation measures under the framework of climate change. The study recommends institutions targeting households' livelihood improvement and making decisions concerning climate change adaptation need to focus on mass media and information technology, improving locally adapted extension services, improved irrigation, expand loan channels.","[Xie, Shuntao; Ding, Wenguang; Ye, Weifeng; Deng, Zhe] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Xie, Shuntao; Ding, Wenguang; Ye, Weifeng] Lanzhou Univ, Key Lab Western Chinas Environm Syst MOE, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University; Lanzhou University,"Ding, WG (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.;Ding, WG (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Key Lab Western Chinas Environm Syst MOE, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",1363010825@qq.com; wgding@lzu.edu.cn,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [no.XDA20100102]; National Key Research and Development Program [2019YFC0507405],Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Key Research and Development Program,"This work was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant no.XDA20100102), the National Key Research and Development Program (Grant No.2019YFC0507405).

However, climate change vulnerability may currently not be sufficiently accounted for in national biofuel strategies, hence neglecting a possible link between mitigation and adaptation to climate change. To the best of our knowledge this potential link has received very little attention in the literature. One example is the Philippines, which is currently implementing an ambitious program of biofuel production. Its aim is to reduce dependency on imported fuel, increase rural employment and incomes, and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The Philippines is frequently battered by tropical typhoons and from 1975 to 2002 the annual average damage to agriculture was 3.047 billion pesos. We calculate wind damage on biofuel feedstock production, and assess the effect that a future potential increase in tropical cyclone intensity would have on energy security, rural development and climate change mitigation in the Philippines. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to obtain the future expected development of typhoon impacts. Based on the Philippines legislated target of 10% biodiesel blend in gasoline by 2011, simulation of the affected area for each feedstock, and expected biofuel feedstock damage is computed for the Philippine's 80 provinces in 2050, for two different typhoon climate change scenarios. Additional indirect economic effects are assessed in a tentative way. The results suggest a modest decrease in biofuel feedstock productivity at the national level, but with strong local differences that are shown to affect the Philippine's policy goals. In a broader perspective the paper accentuates a so far little described link between climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. This link may merit further attention by policy makers and development planners in order to ensure that policies are economically sound not only in the short but also medium term.

As a consequence, extrapolation from past data reaches its limits, and a process-based analysis of farmer adaptation is required. Simulation of changes in crop yields using crop growth models is a first step in that direction. However, changes in crop yields are only one pathway through which climate change affects agricultural production. A meaningful process-based analysis of farmer adaptation requires a whole-farm analysis at the farm level. We use a highly disaggregated mathematical programming model to analyze farm-level climate change adaptation for a mountainous area in southwest Germany. Regional-level results are obtained by simulating each full-time farm holding in the study area. We address parameter uncertainty and model underdetermination using a cautious calibration approach and a comprehensive uncertainty analysis. We deal with the resulting computational burden using efficient experimental designs and high-performance computing. We show that in our study area, shifted crop management time slots can have potentially significant effects on agricultural supply, incomes, and various policy objectives promoted under German and European environmental policy schemes. The simulated effects are robust against model uncertainty and underline the importance of a comprehensive assessment of climate change impacts beyond merely looking at crop yield changes. Our simulations demonstrate how farm-level models can contribute to a process-based analysis of climate change adaptation if they are embedded into a systematic framework for treating inherent model uncertainty.","[Troost, Christian; Berger, Thomas] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Econ & Social Sci Trop & Subtrop, Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Troost, C (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Econ & Social Sci Trop & Subtrop, Stuttgart, Germany.",,"Chekalin, Vyacheslav/S-6391-2017","Chekalin, Vyacheslav/0000-0002-9263-2341; Troost, Christian/0000-0003-4626-7117",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [FOR-1695],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors thank JunJie Wu and one anonymous referee for their careful reading and most helpful comments.

However, there is limited literature on climate change adaptation experiences of African cities, particularly with regard to moving from strategy development to implementation. This continues to hamper efforts to understand and guide city climate change actions on the continent. This article helps address this gap by providing critical insights into the opportunities and challenges experienced, and the solutions found in the process of developing and implementing the Durban Climate Change Strategy (DCCS) in the City of Durban, South Africa. The initial 2015 DCCS was reviewed in 2020/2021, and an analysis of the process and its outcomes provide useful focus areas that could guide other cities across the Global South and beyond for implementing climate change strategies. Based on these focus areas, the article demonstrates that there are considerable governance and other barriers to this process that span multiple scales, but also many opportunities such as good organisation, ongoing support across multiple departments and scales, and perseverance that can be harnessed. The findings have significant practical and policy implications for developing and implementing urban climate strategies and provide important conceptual insights for building transformative resilience in challenging governance contexts.","[O'Donoghue, Sean] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, Room 200,City Engineers Complex,166 KE Masinga Rd, Durban, South Africa; [O'Donoghue, Sean] EThekwini Municipal, Climate Change Adaptat, Climate Change Dept, Room 200,City Engineers Complex,166 KE Masinga Rd, Durban, South Africa; [Morgan, Derek] Urban Earth Pty Ltd, 21 Benzelia,276 Helen Joseph Rd, Durban, South Africa; [Haydvogl, Kathryn] EThekwini Municipal, Room 200,City Engineers Complex,166 KE Masinga Rd, ZA-4001 Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"O'Donoghue, S (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, Room 200,City Engineers Complex,166 KE Masinga Rd, Durban, South Africa.;O'Donoghue, S (corresponding author), EThekwini Municipal, Climate Change Adaptat, Climate Change Dept, Room 200,City Engineers Complex,166 KE Masinga Rd, Durban, South Africa.",dogbiteod@gmail.com; morgan.derek@gmail.com; Hayley.leck@kcl.ac.uk; Kathryn.Haydvogl@durban.gov.za,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,0,"UNIV FREE STATE, DEPT TOWN & REGIONAL PLANNING",BLOEMFONTEIN,"PO BOX 339, BLOEMFONTEIN, 9300, SOUTH AFRICA",1012-280X,2415-0495,,TOWN REG PLAN,Town Reg.

However, most internationally supported capacity assessments focus mainly on one administrative level in their attempts to understand the current capacities and capacity needs of the system under study. This article aims to investigate the potential for discrepancies between what stakeholders on different administrative levels in Fiji express when explaining how their system for managing risk and disaster situations functions. Design/methodology/approach - The study includes semi-structured interviews with involved stakeholders from all administrative levels in Fiji, who are asked to describe what information and assistance is given or requested between administrative levels, in everyday circumstances and in disaster situations. The data were then analysed to identify similarities and differences in descriptions. Findings - The study illustrates that there may be substantial discrepancies between accounts on different administrative levels concerning key functions of their system. Research limitations/implications - The study is not claiming that this always is the case, only that there may be a possibility for it. Potentially undermining the effectiveness of ensuing capacity development activities. Practical implications - Given that capacity assessment is to create a coherent foundation for capacity development, the study indicates that it would beneficial to include a wider range of administrative levels in attempting to construct one comprehensive view of the current capacities and future capacity needs. Originality/value - The research topic is novel and valuable for stakeholders in the international community active in capacity development.","[Becker, Per] Lund Univ, Training Reg Res Ctr, Lund, Sweden; [Becker, Per] Lund Univ, Ctr Risk Assessment & Management, Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University,"Becker, P (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Training Reg Res Ctr, Lund, Sweden.",per.becker@lucram.lu.se,,"Becker, Per/0000-0001-9379-9461",,,,,13,13,13,0,25,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0965-3562,1758-6100,,DISASTER PREV MANAG,Disaster Prev.

This study designs an educational and practical workshop for adaptation to climate change at a local community level. The community universities in Taiwan normally facilitate social activities and informal learnings. This study thus defines the educational or social activities conducted in community universities as community-based affairs. After reviewing the phase II adaption action plan of Taiwan, critical adaptation sectors of disasters and water resources are identified. A case study on designing the community-based adaptation (CBA) workshop for water resources management in the Dahan River Basin is thereby developed. The learning subjects or practicing topics include an introduction to climate change impacts and their mitigation and adaptation; adaptation sectors of disasters, infrastructure, water resources, and agricultural production; and the utilization of water resources under climate change. Concept mapping of climate change impacts and debating possible global climate trends could further encourage participants to think in-depth and to act accordingly. This study also applies the rigor and relevance (R&R) framework to assist in the design of the CBA workshop and thereby to assess the effectiveness after its delivery. To further investigate the two-dimensional R&R levels of the CBA workshop, this study proposes eight combinations of contents and outcomes (tasks). In summary, this workshop gives background knowledge on geography and applies the analysis tool of concept mapping. The 10 learning subjects or practicing topics developed are mostly at the high rigor levels of 4-Analysis and 5-Synthesis. The overall application level of the CBA workshop is ranked as level 4 of predictable real-world application. The eight tasks that can expand the rigorousness of knowledge acquisition and empower the relevance of skill application are found to fall into Quadrant C-Assimilation.","[Hsieh, Ting-Fang; Lee, Yuh-Ming] Natl Taipei Univ, Inst Nat Resource Management, New Taipei 23741, Taiwan",National Taipei University,"Lee, YM (corresponding author), Natl Taipei Univ, Inst Nat Resource Management, New Taipei 23741, Taiwan.",tingfanghsieh@gmail.com; yml@mail.ntpu.edu.tw,,"Lee, Yuh-Ming/0000-0001-5233-4852; Hsieh, Tingfang/0000-0003-0388-8896",Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST109-2621-M-305-001],Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology,This research and the APC was funded in part by Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology under the grant number of MOST109-2621-M-305-001.,,20,1,1,2,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2021,13,4,,,,,,,1729,10.3390/su13041729,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13041729,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QQ9IM,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000624830900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Tracking this finance is particularly problematic for climate change adaptation, as there is no clear definition of what separates adaptation aid from standard development aid. Here we use a historical database of overseas development assistance projects to test the effect of different accounting assumptions on the delivery of adaptation finance to the developing countries of Oceania, using machine algorithms developed from a manual pilot study. The results show that explicit adaptation finance grew to 3%-4% of all development aid to Oceania by the 2008-2012 period, but that total adaptation finance could be as high as 37% of all aid, depending on potentially politically motivated assumptions about what counts as adaptation. There was also an uneven distribution of adaptation aid between countries facing similar challenges like Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia. The analysis indicates that data allowing individual projects to be weighted by their climate change relevance is needed. A robust and mandatory metadata system for all aid projects would allow multilateral aid agencies and independent third parties to perform their own analyses using different assumptions and definitions, and serve as a key check on international climate aid promises.","[Donner, Simon D.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, 1984 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada; [Kandlikar, Milind] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, 2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Kandlikar, Milind] Univ British Columbia, Liu Inst Global Issues, 6476 NW Marine Dr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada; [Webber, Sophie] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, 1255 Bunche Hall,405 Hilgard Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Donner, SD (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, 1984 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",simon.donner@ubc.ca,,"Webber, Sophie/0000-0002-7597-4622",UBC Hampton Research Endowment Fund,UBC Hampton Research Endowment Fund,"This research was funded by the UBC Hampton Research Endowment Fund.

On the grounds of innovative efforts implemented in Barcelona, Rotterdam, and Vienna, we examine the opportunities and obstacles to both Smart Environment (defined as an axis of the Smart City) and adaptation to climate change, linking them together. As it is difficult to estimate the benefits of climate action in the short term due to often costly solutions, Smart City proposals could provide the economic incentive to create adaptive, energy-efficient, and sustainable societies. As the need for adaptive and resilient cities in the global context of climate change rises, the concept of Smart City might need to evolve into that of a Smart Sustainable City, positioning the environment at the core of its development. Results from this analysis suggest that the interaction between technology and nature can be enhanced when a Smart City approach promotes the integration of climate strategies and encourages the participation of citizens, something that is crucial since early adaptation efforts can safeguard smart infrastructure from climate impacts.","[Garcia Fernandez, Cristina; Peek, Daniel] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ Publ Econ & Polit Econ, Madrid 28223, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Fernandez, CG (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ Publ Econ & Polit Econ, Madrid 28223, Spain.",cristinagarcia@cps.ucm.es; dani.peek@gmail.com,"GARCIA FERNANDEZ;GARCIA FERNANDEZ, CRISTINA;CRISTINA/ABC-9531-2021","GARCIA FERNANDEZ;GARCIA FERNANDEZ, CRISTINA;CRISTINA/0000-0001-9573-4805; Peek, Daniel/0000-0003-0882-885X",,,,,63,15,15,20,44,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2624-6511,,SMART CITIES-BASEL,Smart Cities,JUN,2020,3,2,,,,,511,526,,10.3390/smartcities3020027,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/smartcities3020027,,,16,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Urban Studies",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering; Urban Studies,SS5MQ,,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000661799300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The variability of urban heat islands (VUHIs) is known to influence the effectiveness of climate adaptation strategies; however, the understanding of VUHIs is still limited. Here, we quantified the diurnal and seasonal VUHIs in 245 Chinese cities that varied in population and physical size based on the remotely sensing data from 2002 to 2012. Taking the 2012 VUHIs as an example, we examined the relationships between VUHIs and underlying drivers of background climate and urbanization. The results showed that: (1) the VUHIs from 2002 to 2012 had obvious periodicity in different years while significant diurnal and seasonal variability; (2) the explanation rates of local background climate for the diurnal VUHIs were 30% (spring), 19% (summer), 29% (autumn), and 25% (winter), respectively; (3) the explanation rates of urbanization for the diurnal VUHIs were 13% (spring), 22% (summer), 11% (autumn), and 21% (winter), respectively; (4) these two variables also accounted for 32% and 12% of the seasonal VUHIs during the daytime, and 25% and 23% during the nighttime, respectively. Our research suggests that the improvement of urban climate-change adaptation necessitates local climate-smart strategies, a reduction in local anthropogenic heat emissions, and rational use of green planning for sustainable urban development.

In the context of coastal erosion, especially the question of physical access to the landscape for a variety of publics is becoming ever more important. Where a multitude of actors are involved in landscape management, diverging subjective and collective perceptions of these changing landscapes, hold potential for disagreement about suitable adaptive measures. Although the body of literature on the role of subjective values in processes of climate adaptation is growing the societal constructions of respective places and landscapes underlying different adaptation approaches remain under-researched. We show in this paper that how landscapes are understood by actors in environmental management matters for decision-making. In particular, differentunclerstandings of the Cornish landscape at Godrevy Headland are shown to have material implications for how issues of access, visitor management and long-term responses to climate change and coastal erosion are addressed. In the case of Godrevy, coastal erosion has required local actors to plan the relocation of a visitor car park, bringing contrasting perspectives on the landscape, its use and protection to the fore. Uncovering the individual and collective assumptions about the landscape behind these conflicting narratives, is vital for fostering inclusive policy and planning processes around climate change adaptation.","[Koepsel, Vera] Univ Hamburg, Inst Marine Ecosyst & Fisheries Sci, Grosse Elbstr 133, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany; [Walsh, Cormac] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg; University of Hamburg,"Kopsel, V (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Marine Ecosyst & Fisheries Sci, Grosse Elbstr 133, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany.",vera.koepsel@uni-hamburg.de; cormac.walsh@uni-hamburg.de,,"Kopsel, Vera/0000-0003-0751-0778","Cluster of Excellence 'CliSAP', University of Hamburg through the German Science Foundation (DFG) [EXC177]","Cluster of Excellence 'CliSAP', University of Hamburg through the German Science Foundation (DFG)","This research was supported through the Cluster of Excellence 'CliSAP' (EXC177), University of Hamburg, funded through the German Science Foundation (DFG).

The objective of this study was to assess the suitability (and the best combination) of agro-ecological techniques as potential resilience strategies in organic horticultural systems in a Mediterranean environment. A long-term experimental device called MITIORG (Long-term climatic change adaptation in organic farming: synergistic combination of hydraulic arrangement, crop rotations, agro-ecological service crops and agronomic techniques) is set-up at Metaponto (MT), testing the following agro-ecological measures as well as organic and conservation farming best practices: i) hydraulic arrangement by a kind of ridge-furrow system; ii) cash crop rotations; iii) agro-ecological service crops (ASC) introduction; iv) ASC termination techniques (green manure vs roller crimper); and v) organic fertilisation. The research here reported was carried out during the 2014-2015 season in the MITIORG device, on a rotation of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L.) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) crops. A detailed description of the scientific cognitive process that led to setup of the device, its components explanation, as well as preliminary yield results are reported. The outcomes suggest that organic vegetable cropping systems, designed following agro-ecological principles, are able to sustain yield of cash crops in rotation, in spite of changes in temperature and rainfall of the study site.

This article reviews the major impacts and challenges of disaster and climate change risks on sustainable development, and summarizes the courses and linkages of disaster risk reduction (DRR), climate change adaptation (CCA), and sustainable development over the past 30 years. Our findings show that the conceptual development of DRR actions has gone through three general phases: disaster management in the 1990s, risk management in the 2000s, and resilient management and development in the 2010s. Gradually, CCA has been widely implemented to overcome the adverse effects of climate change. A framework is proposed for tackling climate change and disaster risks in the context of resilient, sustainable development, indicating that CCA is not a subset of DRR while they have similarities and differences in their scope and emphasis. It is crucial to transform governance mechanisms at different levels, so as to integrate CCA and DRR to reduce disaster and climate change risks, and achieve safe growth and a resilient future in the era of the Anthropocene.","[Wen, Jiahong; Wan, Chengcheng; Li, Weijiang] Shanghai Normal Univ, Sch Environm & Geog Sci, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China; [Ye, Qian] Integrated Risk Governance Project, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Yan, Jianping] Rodel Risk Solut Inc, Toronto, ON M1W1J3, Canada",Shanghai Normal University,"Li, WJ (corresponding author), Shanghai Normal Univ, Sch Environm & Geog Sci, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China.",lwj@shnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [42171080, 41771540]; National Social Science Foundation of China [18ZDA105]; Humanities and Social Sciences Program of the Ministry of Education [21YJC630146]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China; Humanities and Social Sciences Program of the Ministry of Education,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 42171080, 41771540), the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 18ZDA105),~and the Humanities and Social Sciences Program of the Ministry of Education (Grant No. 21YJC630146).",,88,0,0,3,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2095-0055,2192-6395,,INT J DISAST RISK SC,Int.

We examine the question of optimal adaptation to climate change in a vintage capital growth model without uncertainty. Along the optimal pathway, adaptation is proactive with an anticipation period of approximately twenty years. While there is additional investment in this scenario compared with a no-climate-change baseline, the overall cost to adapt is low relative to the potential losses from maladaptation. Over-investment in protection capital allows the economy to be consistently well-adapted to climate; thus, such a policy prevents transient maladaptation costs. Sensitivity analysis with an integrated assessment model suggests that costs could be ten times larger if adaptation only begins after vulnerable sectors are impacted.","[Dumas, Patrice] Ecole Normale Super, Meteorol Dynam Lab, F-75231 Paris, France; [Dumas, Patrice] CIRED, Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Ha-Duong, Minh] CNRS, CIRED, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); AgroParisTech; CIRAD; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; AgroParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Dumas, P (corresponding author), Ecole Normale Super, Meteorol Dynam Lab, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75231 Paris, France.",dumas@centre-cired.fr,,"Ha-Duong, Minh/0000-0001-9988-2100",Ile de France region under R2DS research programme; ANR,Ile de France region under R2DS research programme(Region Ile-de-France); ANR(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"We acknowledge financial support from the Ile de France region under the R2DS research programme and from the ANR research project AMTools.

Eight focus groups with 53 Michigan farmers were conducted in 2011-12 to better understand the following: 1) what do farmers think about the relationship between climate change and agriculture, 2) what differentiates normal weather-related management from climate change adaptation actions, and 3) how do farmers understand the term climate change adaptation.'' Farmers expressed skepticism at global climate change yet conveyed specific details about the local changes in climate they are experiencing on their farms. They were not able to clearly define the term climate change adaptation'' but did note specific adaptive actions they have already implemented. The farmers explained that nonclimate factors were of more concern to them when making management decisions, and they showed reactive (not proactive) actions toward adaptation. Farmers noted that any action they take has to address their specific situation, suggesting that generalized adaptation actions and language might not resonate with them. Building on quantitative surveys conducted by others, the findings in this paper contribute to ongoing efforts to more effectively assess farmers' perceptions related to climate change adaptation and to use that understanding to promote education, outreach, research, and public policies to more proactively address the consequences posed by climate change.","[Doll, Julie E.] Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; No Arizona Univ, Flagstaff, AZ USA; [Bode, Claire] Michigan State Univ Extens, E Lansing, MI USA",Michigan State University; Northern Arizona University; Michigan State University,"Doll, JE (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",jedoll@msu.edu,,,U.S. EPA [NE 00E00331]; Michigan State University's Project GREEEN [GR10-089]; Michigan's Plant Agriculture Initiative housed at Michigan State University; National Science Foundation's Long-Term Ecological Research Program at the W.K.

Although climate change is considered inevitable, adaptive measures must be taken in the field of architecture to alleviate its impact. Creating an overview of the state of the art in the field of architecture as it adapts to climate change will help identify the problems and possibilities of architectural adaptation. The aim must be to create buildings that are as suitable to the current climate as they are to the climate of the future and maintain an ability to resist the impacts of climate change; this ability to resist potential change is defined as adaptive capacity. It is challenging to reconcile the energy requirements for contemporary buildings with rising temperatures and extreme weather in temperate climate zones. The literature on the subject is explored through iterative searches in scientific databases. In discussions about the possible adaptations to climate change, there needs to be a focus on human adaptation facilitated by architecture and the built environment's utilization and support of ecosystem services in adaptation strategies, since the scope of climate change reaches beyond the singular building. There are plenty of strategies and technologies from which to draw but little focus on how these should support the design of a building and its inhabitants. In the future it will be necessary to look at the adaptive capacity of a building itself and how the building can benefit its surroundings.","[Poulsen, Mikkel; Lauring, Michael; Brunsgaard, Camilla] Aalborg Univ, Dept Architecture Design & Media Technol, Aalborg, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Poulsen, M (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Dept Architecture Design & Media Technol, Aalborg, Denmark.",mpou@create.aau.dk,,"Brunsgaard, Camilla/0000-0002-9554-0426",,,,,66,1,1,7,18,COLLEGE PUBLISHING,GLEN ALLEN,"12309 LYNWOOD DR, GLEN ALLEN, VA 23059 USA",1552-6100,1943-4618,,J GREEN BUILD,J.

In this article, we examine the coherence and contradictions between national policies and plans, and its impacts on the implementation of adaptation measures at the local level. We undertook a content review of key climate change policy documents (n = 4) of Nepal. In addition, we conducted a field study in the Rajdevi Community Forest User Group (CFUG) located in the mid-hills of Nepal, which has developed and implemented a community level adaptation plan of action (CAPA). The field study involved household interviews, focus group discussions, and an in-depth analysis of CAPA implementation. The paper found that while policies are coherent for targeting highly affected areas and communities, they deviate from discerning an appropriate planning and implanting unit. The local adaptation plan of action (LAPA) considers the local government as an implementing unit, while the national adaptation program of action (NAPA) puts an emphasis on the local community groups. It suggests that the existing LAPA implementation breaches the provision of community-level institutions for the implementation conceived in the central framework. Despite little attention to promoting food security in climate change policy, through the CAPA, local communities have planned and implemented adaptation measures envisioned in the thematic areas identified in the climate change policy of Nepal: agriculture and food security; forests and biodiversity; water resources and energy; climate-induced disasters; public health; and urban settlements and infrastructure. Nevertheless, the CAPA is not institutionalized under government policies and the institutional framework as a local level implementing unit. So, the consensus for a local implementing unit in the policies has remained a key issue. We suggest identifying a suitable and acceptable unit for implementing climate change adaptation at the community level. Only if an appropriate implementing unit is identified can the policies be successful with a broader acceptance and desirable outcomes enshrined in the climate change policy.","[Darjee, Kumar Bahadur; Koehl, Michael; Neupane, Prem Raj] Univ Hamburg, World Forestry, Leuschner Str 91, D-21031 Hamburg, Germany; [Sunam, Ramesh Kumar] Waseda Univ, Waseda Inst Adv Study, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan; [Neupane, Prem Raj] Friends Nat FON, POB 23491, Kathmandu, Nepal",University of Hamburg; Waseda University,"Darjee, KB (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, World Forestry, Leuschner Str 91, D-21031 Hamburg, Germany.",kumar.darjee@studium.uni-hamburg.de; sunam@aoni.waseda.jp; michael.koehl@uni-hamburg.de; prem.raj.neupane@uni-hamburg.de,,"Darjee, Kumar/0000-0002-0881-3589",,,,,114,4,4,0,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2021,13,23,,,,,,,13115,10.3390/su132313115,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132313115,,,32,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XV0GA,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000734630500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results indicated that 72% of the respondents perceived climate change-associated impacts, while 82% and 85% perceived the changes in temperature and precipitation, respectively. Most respondents perceived climate warming and decreases in precipitation. Drought and erratic rainfall are the most serious impacts. Approximately 40% of respondents who perceived climate change have chosen to do nothing. Others have reacted by migrating for work, introducing new crop types, giving up planting certain crops, and investing in irrigation infrastructure. The perception and response strategies of local residents to climate change were mainly influenced by the factors related to geographical characteristics and residents' livelihoods. There are significant differences in perception of climate change among Tibetan, Yi and Naxi, while no significant differences in response strategies have been found among ethnic minorities. An integrated programme combining indigenous knowledge with scientific technology and government policies is proposed to enhance the adaptive capacity to climate change of ethnic populations in mountain areas.

Many organizations working to increase resilience to climate change with local communities also recognize the importance of gender, yet the degree to which gender is actually integrated in climate change projects is unclear. This study examines the extent to which organizations involved in climate change and resilience work in sub-Saharan Africa are integrating research on gender and climate change and incorporating gender-sensitive approaches into their programmes using data collected through a knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey and key informant interviews targeted at government agencies, local and international NGOs, and other practitioners. The results show that although organizations have access to research on climate change from various sources, more is needed to identify entry points for gender integration into climate change adaptation programmes across a range of local contexts. Lack of staff capacity on gender, lack of funding to support gender integration, and socio-cultural constraints were identified as key barriers to gender integration by many respondents, particularly from government agencies. Enabling organizations to pay greater attention to the gender dimensions of their programmes is possible through greater collaboration across different types of organizations in order to share knowledge and best practices and strengthen the integration of research into adaptation programmes.","[Bryan, Elizabeth] Int Food Policy Res Inst IFPRI, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Bernier, Quinn] Brown Univ, Dept Sociol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Espinal, Marcia] Amer Univ, School Int Serv, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Ringler, Claudia] IFPRI, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Brown University; American University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Bryan, E (corresponding author), Int Food Policy Res Inst IFPRI, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",e.bryan@cgiar.org,,"Bryan, Elizabeth/0000-0002-0906-222X",UK Department for International Development (DfID) under the project 'Gendered Approach to Climate Change Adaptation' [CRP137-11CRP072-15],UK Department for International Development (DfID) under the project 'Gendered Approach to Climate Change Adaptation',"This work was implemented by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) (CRP137-11CRP072-15) with funding from the UK Department for International Development (DfID) under the project 'Gendered Approach to Climate Change Adaptation'.",,39,16,17,1,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The study is based on fieldwork in the Northern and Upper East regions of Ghana. The programme examined has been designed to reflect the need of each community instead of general adaptation strategies. Findings from the study suggest that the communities involved have achieved positive outcomes from the approach. Capacity building and advocacy training have made the involved communities more proactive, which has increased the collaboration between the communities and local governance. Climate change adaptation has now become one of the key priorities on the political agenda of the local district assemblies. However, lack of funding hinders the achievements to be expanded to the rest of the district.

We propose evolving social contracts as a primary mechanism by which adaptation to climate change proceeds. We use a natural experiment of policy and social contexts of the UK and Ireland affected by the same meteorological event and resultant flooding in November 2009. We analyse data from policy documents and from household surveys of 356 residents in western Ireland and northwest England. We find significant differences between perceptions of individual responsibility for protection across the jurisdictions and between perceptions of future risk from populations directly affected by flooding events. These explain differences in stated willingness to take individual adaptive actions when state support retrenches. We therefore show that expectations for state protection are critical in mediating impacts and promoting longer-term adaptation. We argue that making social contracts explicit may smooth pathways to effective and legitimate adaptation.","[Adger, W.

The need for adaptation is most urgent in developing countries, yet most research has focused on the barriers to climate change mainstreaming in municipalities of the global North. This paper presents the results of a study that investigated barriers to action on climate change adaptation in eight municipalities in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Forty-seven municipal actors (officials and councillors) were interviewed regarding the experience of their municipality with climate impacts and adaptive actions (focussing on ecosystem-based adaptation), as well as their knowledge and belief on climate change and adaptation issues. Results show that multiple barriers affect the ability of municipalities to mainstream adaptation issues, from individual-level barriers (such as a lack of understanding of climate change and adaptation options) to regulatory/institutional barriers (such as the problems posed by party politics) to socio-cultural barriers (such as a lack of interest within municipal constituencies for climate change issues). These numerous barriers are not significantly different to those encountered so far in municipalities of the developed world, suggesting that across the globe there are common problems that national and provincial governments need to address in order to mainstream climate change adaptation at the local level (such as changing planning and other laws by which local governments operate in order to recognise climate change impacts). Our research draws attention to a couple of under-researched issues, that of the effects of party politics and councillor qualifications on local government operation and performance, and suggests that much further research should address these topics in both developed and developing countries.

We address this question through statistical models of adaptation policy actors' assessments of access to scientific/technical information as well as their perceptions of cooperation and procedural fairness across numerous adaptation decision-making processes operating in the Lake Victoria region, East Africa. We measured actors' collaborative interactions as well as their participation in task forces, steering committees, and other policy forums that have emerged in response to the challenges of building adaptive capacity to the effects of climate change in the region. Because information access, cooperation, and procedural fairness are shaped by social processes, we tested how the performance of policy forums varied according to different measures of social capital. Specifically, we distinguished between bridging social capital (the value of relationships that span or broker between distinct subgroups) and bonding social capital (which results from frequent interaction or from clustered relationships within subgroups). We found that measures of bridging social capital had a positive effect on actors' assessments of their access to information in policy forums, but a negative effect on their perceptions of cooperation and procedural fairness in forums. In contrast, measures of bonding social capital had a positive effect on cooperation and procedural fairness, but no effect on information access. Taken together, our results suggest that different forms of social capital have separateand potentially opposingeffects on distinct measures of the performance of adaptation policy forums. The relative importance of each performance measure, which may vary from one policy forum to another, should guide efforts to encourage different forms of social capital across the numerous decision-making processes that comprise regional climate change adaptation governance systems.","[Hamilton, Matthew L.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 2021 Coffey Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Lubell, Mark] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95618 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Hamilton, ML (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 2021 Coffey Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",hamilton.1323@osu.edu,"Hamilton, Matt/HJP-9671-2023","Lubell, Mark/0000-0001-5757-7116; Hamilton, Matthew/0000-0003-0509-4467",NSF Division of Graduate Education (DGE) [0801430]; Responding to Rapid Environmental Change (REACH) IGERT award; UC Davis,NSF Division of Graduate Education (DGE)(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)); Responding to Rapid Environmental Change (REACH) IGERT award; UC Davis,"This research was partially supported by NSF Division of Graduate Education (DGE) #0801430, the Responding to Rapid Environmental Change (REACH) IGERT awarded to UC Davis, and a Jastro-Shields grant from UC Davis.",,93,19,19,0,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The results are as follows: the perception of tourists on climate change exerts a significant positive effect on attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, which, in turn, exerts significant positive effects on climate change adaptation intentions. Furthermore, climate change adaptation intentions exert a significant positive influence on the behavioral patterns of PEB. Finally, political trust exerts a moderating effect on the relationship between subjective norms and climate change adaptation intentions and between perceived behavioral control and climate change adaptation intentions.

In developing the plan, a pragmatic method was adopted for characterizing current vulnerabilities. This was founded on the bottom-up approach and supported with past events data, including evaluating their impacts, and the adaptive capacity of systems and utilities to climate extremes. In water supply, the effects of more severe and frequent extreme events are being felt with respect to water quality and availability, representing as much as 80% of the events studied, whereas, in terms of sanitation, floods account for about 90% of events identified.

Using LRF in decision-making, to reduce the risks and seize the opportunities, represents short-term adaptation to climate change. High-resolution ensemble forecasts (51 forecasts) were made for a period of 7 months and were initiated on the first day of each month. For the initial testing of the capacity of LRF to provide useful information for producers, 2017 was chosen as the test year as it had a very hot summer and severe drought, which caused significant impacts on agricultural production. LRF was very useful in predicting the variables which bear the memory of the longer period, such are growing degree days for the prediction of dates of the phenophases' occurrences and the soil moisture of deeper soil layers as an indicator for the drought. Other project activities included field observations, communication with producers, web portal development, etc. Our results showed that the selected priority forecasting products were also identified by the producers as being the highest weather-related risks, the operational forecast implementation with the products designed for the use in agricultural production is proven to be urgent and necessary for decision-making, and required investments are affordable. The total cost of the full upgrade of agrometeorological climate services to meet current needs (including monitoring, seamless forecasting system development and the development of tools for information dissemination) was found to be about three orders of magnitude lower than the assessed losses in agricultural production in the two extreme years over the past decade.","[Vimic, Ana Vukovic; Rankovic-Vasic, Zorica; Nikolic, Dragan; Cosic, Marija; Lipovac, Aleksa; Sotonica, Dunja; Vojvodic, Dijana; Mandic, Mirjam Vujadinovic] Univ Belgrade, Fac Agr, Nemanjina 6, Belgrade 11080, Serbia; [Djurdjevic, Vladimir] Univ Belgrade, Fac Phys, Dobracina 16, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Cvetkovic, Bojan] Republ Hydrometeorol Serv Serbia, Kneza Viseslava 66, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",University of Belgrade; University of Belgrade,"Vimic, AV (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Fac Agr, Nemanjina 6, Belgrade 11080, Serbia.",anavuk@agrif.bg.ac.rs,,"Cosic, Marija/0000-0001-8087-9788; Vukovic Vimic, Ana/0000-0003-2528-3169; Lipovac, Aleksa/0000-0001-6194-5495; Cvetkovic, Bojan/0000-0003-0079-1044; Djurdjevic, Vladimir/0000-0001-9882-1189",Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia through the PROMIS Integrated Agrometeorological Prediction System (IAPS) project [6062629],Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia through the PROMIS Integrated Agrometeorological Prediction System (IAPS) project,This research was funded by the Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia through the PROMIS Integrated Agrometeorological Prediction System (IAPS) project under grant number 6062629.,,34,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,AUG,2022,13,8,,,,,,,1337,10.3390/atmos13081337,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13081337,,,32,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,4C2WX,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000846321600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper mainly examines the role of participatory tools and techniques with the potential to identify the level of vulnerability and likely adaptation measures to increase the forest resilience capacities of communities where CAPA has been prepared (i.e. CAPA group). In total, 13 participatory qualitative tools were evaluated against 15 criteria for identifying their performance in nine CAPA groups representing three geo-graphical regions of Nepal. Multivariate analyses of the participatory tools and their performance allowed for selecting the most similar and dissimilar CAPA groups. The results indicated how CAPA groups are evaluating the likelihood of climate change impact, determining the vulnerability of specific ecosystem services and understanding the possible local adaptation measures. Many methods do not offer conditions for exploiting new innovative opportunities, assessing scenarios or identifying ecosystem services in the CAPA process. Tools are required that consider qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods, measure vulnerability and ecosystem functions and services. Although many issues related to local conditions and vulnerabilities have not been tapped adequately, it is difficult to generalize individual case study results within the different geographical contexts of Nepal. The integration of adaptation planning in local institutions, in order to deal with different ecosystem-based adaptation options, along with identification of climate change scenarios, impacts, trade-offs, synergies and the sensitivity of management problems, is highly recommended.","[Khadka, Chiranjeewee; Edwards-Jonasova, Magda; Cudlin, Pavel] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Global Change Res Inst, Lipova 9, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Aryal, Keshava Prasad; Upadhyaya, Anju] Nat & Org Resource Management Serv NORMS Pvt Ltd, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Dhungana, Nabin] CARE Nepal Cent Off, 4-288 SAMATA Bhawan,POB 1661, Lalitpur, Nepal; [Vacik, Harald] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Inst Silviculture, Vienna, Austria","Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Khadka, C (corresponding author), Acad Sci Czech Republic, Global Change Res Inst, Lipova 9, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",khadka.c@czechglobe.cz,"Khadka, Chiranjeewee/E-2163-2015; Vacik, Harald/B-1185-2009","Khadka, Chiranjeewee/0000-0001-9032-6933; Vacik, Harald/0000-0002-5668-6967; Dhungana, Nabin/0000-0001-8112-7537","CARE/Nepal; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of Czech Republic within the National Sustainability Program I (NPU I) [LO1415]","CARE/Nepal; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of Czech Republic within the National Sustainability Program I (NPU I)","The authors would like to thank for the valuable comments of anonymous reviewers which helped to shape the key messages of the manuscript.

Despite the growing need for collaborative and multi-agency efforts in climate change adaptation, however, current airport and transportation governance structures reinforce siloed approaches to manage climate risk. Here we combine a novel coastal flooding exposure assessment of California's airports and a policy review to address the importance of collaborative climate adaptation by viewing airport infrastructures as inter-connected systems across spatial scales and sectors. Our exposure assessment innovates by investigating the airport perimeter, its interconnected infrastructure (road access, ground-based navigation and communications systems), and multimodal interregional transportation corri-dors. At the local scale, we find that substantial airport assets are exposed as early as 2020-2040, suggesting the urgency for near-term adaptation actions. Regarding the interconnected in-frastructures, 23 unaccounted airports are identified at risk of disruption when compared with existing studies, including global hubs such as the Los Angeles International Airport. At the regional scale, we investigate how exposed airports transfer risk within the interregional multi -modal transportation corridors, and we identify the critical airports within these corridors to be prioritized for adaptation. Finally, based on a policy review of more than 100 state legislature and planning documents, implications of our results are discussed at the national and state levels. This study presents a new generation of infrastructure exposure assessment to climate-induced hazards, by addressing cross-sectoral and multiscalar dependencies that are currently overlooked by adaptation policies. We also argue that new modes of collaborative efforts are needed to achieve effective climate adaptation for interconnected infrastructures.","[Lindbergh, S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 107E McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ju, Y.] Nanjing Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, 812 Jianliang Bldg, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China; [He, Y.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, 412 Wurster Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Radke, J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, Dept City & Reg Planning, 412 Wurster Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rakas, J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, FAA Consortium Aviat Operat Res NEXTOR III, 107B McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [He, Y.] Stanford Univ, Doerr Sch Sustainabil, Dept Geophys, 359 Mitchell Earth Sci Bldg, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Nanjing University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Stanford University,"Ju, Y (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, 812 Jianliang Bldg, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China.",sarah_lindbergh@berkeley.edu; yangju90@nju.edu.cn; yiyihe@stanford.edu; ratt@berkeley.edu; jrakas@ce.berkeley.edu,,"Lindbergh, Sarah/0000-0002-0138-3088",,,,,103,0,0,4,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

'Mainstreaming' climate information, policies and measures into ongoing development planning and decision-making has been proposed as one solution, making a more sustainable, effective and efficient use of resources than designing and managing climate policies separately from ongoing activities. But what does mainstreaming look like in practice? This paper reviews the process of mainstreaming in Bangladesh, one of the countries that has made significant progress on adaptation planning and mainstreaming. The paper begins by making the case for mainstreaming, by exploring linkages and trade-offs between adaptation and development and reviewing the literature on mainstreaming. Second, it considers how to implement mainstreaming in practice, reviewing an existing four-step framework. Examining this framework against the plethora of mainstreaming experiences in Bangladesh, the paper considers how the framework can be used as a tool to review progress on mainstreaming in Bangladesh. The paper concludes that while the framework is useful for considering some of the preconditions necessary for mainstreaming, experiences in Bangladesh reflect a much more complex patchwork of processes and stakeholders that need to be taken into consideration in further research.","[Ayers, Jessica] Dept Energy & Climate Change, London, England; [Huq, Saleemul] Int Inst Environm & Dev, London, England; [Huq, Saleemul] Int Ctr Climate Change & Dev, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Wright, Helena] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Environm Policy, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Faisal, Arif M.] Bangladesh Resident Mission, Asian Dev Bank, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Hussain, Syed Tanveer] Climate Change Co, Dhaka, Bangladesh",Imperial College London,"Wright, H (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Environm Policy, London SW7 2AZ, England.",helena.wright09@imperial.ac.uk,,,,,,,66,71,71,3,37,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Literature highlights that the success of these adaptation efforts generally hinges upon the nature of existing formal and informal rural institutions. This paper uses largely a qualitative approach to understand institutional structural issues and the role of institutions and institutional arrangements in facilitating local level adaptation. From our research we note three salient findings and their implications for incorporating institutions in local level adaptation. First, the public and private institutions in the study areas play a key role in facilitating adaptation, which appears to be in contrast to previous research in which societal configurations indicate greater state retreat over the past two to three decades. Second, while there appears to be a straightforward distinction between public, private and civic institutions in terms of their functions, we suggest caution given the fuzziness and fluidity of institutional categorization on the ground. Third, it appears that institutions and institutional arrangements of an informal nature foster collective action, that they have remained important over the past decades and remain a critical entry point into dealing with exclusionary tendencies against the vulnerable in communities. Within a broader discussion of the role of institutional frameworks in facilitating adaptation our case contributes to the broader issues of the inevitability of ultimately dealing with development challenges in the process of fostering local level adaptation.

This is because of the terrible historical experience of governance during the New Order era, including the state's dominant role, the government's unwillingness to engage actors outside the state, and a centralized and top-down development pattern. Collaborative governance, specifically the recommendation to involve multiple stakeholders (government, private sector, and society) in government management and public policy, addresses these issues. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to provide a critical review of the ongoing collaborative governance process and to determine whether various challenges associated with collaborative governance are influencing the success of climate change adaptation policies in increasing adaptive capacity in Bandar Lampung City. This study was conducted in Bandar Lampung City on the Indonesian island of Sumatra using a qualitative approach and involved informants who were both apparatus and members of the Bandar Lampung City Climate Change Resilience Coordination Team. Interviews and document analysis were used to collect data, which were then analyzed using a content analysis procedure. The findings indicate that this city has achieved a number of milestones in its efforts to improve the adaptive capacity of government institutions and society. However, the collaborative governance approach, which is hailed as the optimal method for implementing long-term public policies, is not always smooth, demonstrating that collaborative governance remains vulnerable to failure due to cultural, institutional, and political factors. The article concludes with suggestions for future research.","[Mukhlis, Maulana] Univ Lampung, Fac Social & Polit Sci, Bandar Lampung 35145, Indonesia; [Perdana, Ryzal] Univ Lampung, Fac Teacher Training & Educ, Bandar Lampung 35145, Indonesia",Universitas Lampung; Universitas Lampung,"Mukhlis, M (corresponding author), Univ Lampung, Fac Social & Polit Sci, Bandar Lampung 35145, Indonesia.",maulana.mukhlis@fisip.unila.ac.id; ryzalperdana@fkip.unila.ac.id,"Perdana, Ryzal/AAN-7381-2021","Perdana, Ryzal/0000-0001-6845-1797; Mukhlis, Maulana/0000-0003-0994-4422",Universitas Lampung [1068/UN26.21/PN/2021],Universitas Lampung,This research was funded by Universitas Lampung [grant number 1068/UN26.21/PN/2021 dated 21 April 2021] and the funding includes the article's Article Processing Charge (APC).,,61,2,2,2,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2022,14,7,,,,,,,4077,10.3390/su14074077,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14074077,,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0L5VC,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000781539900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Proposed solutions to the effects of climate change in the Pacific Islands have often been uncritically imposed from elsewhere and have often proved unsuited to both their environmental and cultural contexts. Effective solutions to challenges of climate change in the Pacific Islands should acknowledge their unique environmental characteristics, particularly their high insularity (coastal length to land area) ratios, their topographic and geological diversity, and the raw materials available to support adaptation. It is important for policy makers to understand the cultural influences that have helped shape current environmental decision making, and the ways in which adaptations to climate change can be sustained. The efficacy of donor preferences for aid funding of policy development (top-down) rather than empowering community-level decision-makers (bottom-up) is questionable. Pacific Island governments are focused on economic growth, with little tangible investment in non-profit environmental sustainability. In the future they should take on ownership of the climate-change adaptation process to a greater degree than they do at present, with external assistance brought in only for special cases and for the trialling of novel solutions, rather than for routine adaptation. Globally, there should be less emphasis on sea-level rise as the principal challenge posed by climate change to Pacific Island nations and a better appreciation of the other challenges, particularly inundation and salinization of economically critical lowland, as well as coral-reef degradation.","Univ S Pacific, Div Geog, Fac Sci Technol & Environm, Suva, Fiji Islands, Fiji",University of the South Pacific,"Nunn, PD (corresponding author), Univ S Pacific, Div Geog, Fac Sci Technol & Environm, Suva, Fiji Islands, Fiji.",nunn_p@usp.ac.fj,"Nunn, Patrick D./C-7864-2011; Nunn, Patrick/ABA-2943-2021","Nunn, Patrick D./0000-0001-9295-5741; Nunn, Patrick/0000-0001-9295-5741",,,,,74,133,135,4,63,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0936-577X,,,CLIM RES,Clim.

With regard to the latter, it should be noted that project directors are an important arm of state bureaucracy in Bangladesh who guide the whole implementation and management of a development project, including its financial, regulatory, and informational dimensions. More specifically, we ask whether generalists or professionals are appointed as directors of the relevant projects.

Yet, it is unclear whose and what kind of vulnerability is reduced through relocation, and which factors are important in determining the success of relocation efforts as strategies for development, climate change adaptation (CCA), and disaster risk reduction (DRR). Temporary and short distance relocation is highly likely to achieve increased resilience by reducing exposure, but relocation to a new area and new communities brings a range of issues. CCA and DRR use different timescales and focal points regarding relocation: CCA focuses on future mass permanent relocation and the subsequent potential loss of cultures and identities mainly due to projected sea level rise. The DRR community focuses on temporary relocation as a way to reduce exposure to a range of hazards, although it is also involved in permanent movement as a transformative way to reduce risk and enhance development. We explore these differences in this paper, with examples mainly from the Pacific Small Island Developing States where past relocations have been numerous. Better understanding and articulation of the underlying assumptions and preferences in CCA, DRR, and development discourses on planned community relocation could provide a richer context for future planning and dealing with both slow-onset and sudden disasters.","[Nalau, Johanna] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, GCCRP, Gold Coast Campus, Qld 4222, Australia; [Nalau, Johanna] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Griffith Inst Tourism GIFT, Gold Coast Campus, Qld 4222, Australia; [Handmer, John] RMIT Univ, Sch Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Nalau, J (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, GCCRP, Gold Coast Campus, Qld 4222, Australia.;Nalau, J (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Griffith Inst Tourism GIFT, Gold Coast Campus, Qld 4222, Australia.",j.nalau@griffith.edu.au; john.handmer@rmit.edu.au,"Nalau, Johanna/V-5692-2018","Nalau, Johanna/0000-0001-6581-3967",,,,,66,15,15,2,22,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2018,10,10,,,,,,,3545,10.3390/su10103545,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10103545,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GY4UB,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000448559400187,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, it is often the case that not every adaptation measure would be practical and adoptable in a specific region. Farmers may have their own ways of managing and adapting to climate change that need to be taken into account when considering interventions. This study aimed to engage with farmers to: (1) better understand small-holder knowledge, attitudes and practices in relation to perceived or expected climate change; and (2) document cropping practices, climate change perceptions, constraints to crop production, and coping and adaptation options with existing climate variability and expected climate change. This study was conducted in 2015 in Sala Krau village near Pailin (12 degrees 52'N, 102 degrees 45'E) and Samlout (12 degrees 39'N, 102 degrees 36'E) of North-West Cambodia. The methods used were a combination of focus group discussions and one-on-one interviews where 132 farming households were randomly selected. We found that farmers were conscious of changes in climate over recent years, and had a good understanding of likely future changes. While farmers are aware of some practices that can be modified to minimize risk and cope with anticipated changes, they are reluctant to apply them. Furthermore; there are no government agricultural extension services provided at the village level and farmers have relied on each other and other actors in the value chain network for information to support their decision-making. There is a lack of knowledge of the principles of conservation agriculture that urgently require agricultural extension services in the region to build farmer ability to better cope and adapt to climate change.

Numerous decision-making strategies have been developed to reduce uncertainty, evaluate options under multiple future scenarios, or create decision pathways in an effort to overcome barriers that prevent adaptation decision-making from being a 'rational' process: a careful and objective evaluation of how alternative options perform under future conditions. Other fields, such as cognitive science, economics, and psychology, have explored alternatives to rational decision-making such as heuristics, and applied adaptation research has illustrated the role of context in shaping decision-making. This article reviews recent research on adaptation decision-making strategies and highlights gaps that future research should address to inform practice. While decision-making methods and tools have proliferated, there is still a lack of research on how adaptation strategies are selected in practice and a need for research on the meta decision-making question: How should decision-makers choose which decision-making process to use?","[Siders, A.

Adaptation planning, correspondingly, is guided by three frameworks categorized as the hazard-based, the vulnerability-based, and the urban resilience framework. Exploring in which ways these frameworks affect the proposed adaptation initiatives is crucial for planners to justify the well-fit approach for adaptation planning. This study seeks to examine the influence of these theoretical frameworks on the formulation of adaptation initiatives with a sample of 45 coastal cities in developing countries. The vulnerability framework is found to tackle the issues of climate change sufficiently while the hazard-based approach shares resources for both climate change and other matters, and the urban resilience framework puts more effort into other issues rather than climate change. From these findings, the study offers implications for adaptation planning in applying each of these three frameworks.","[Tu Dam Ngoc Le] Univ Buffalo State Univ New York, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Buffalo, NY 14222 USA; [Tu Dam Ngoc Le] Mientrung Univ Civil Engn, Fac Architecture, Tuy Hoa, Vietnam",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Le, TDN (corresponding author), Univ Buffalo State Univ New York, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Buffalo, NY 14222 USA.;Le, TDN (corresponding author), Mientrung Univ Civil Engn, Fac Architecture, Tuy Hoa, Vietnam.",ledamngoctu@muce.edu.vn,,,"Vietnam International Education Development, Ministry of Education and Training","Vietnam International Education Development, Ministry of Education and Training","The author would like to acknowledge the Ph.D. fellowship from Vietnam International Education Development, Ministry of Education and Training, and Prof. G.

A climate science perspective,CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Review,,,,,,climate decision-making; uncertainty; climate change attribution; loss and damage,FLOOD RISK; ADAPTATION; UNCERTAINTY; ATTRIBUTION; MANAGEMENT; ROBUST,"Loss and damage (L&D) of climate change is a relatively new work stream of the international climate change regime. Lacking a clear official definition, L&D has triggered a debate about framing the topic, incorporating technical aspects of disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation as well as political considerations such as the idea of compensation for vulnerable countries. This paper reviews the implications of L&D for decision-making with a special focus on the role of climate science. We identify three broad policy goals embedded in the discussion: creating awareness about the sensitivity of human and natural systems to climate change; developing risk reduction and risk management approaches to enhance adaptation, reduce vulnerability and build resilience and informing compensation mechanisms. For all of these, an understanding of the current and future climate-related L&D is needed. Existing decision-making frameworks can help deal with uncertainties and avoid a 'wait and see' mentality for most L&D decisions. The compensation component of L&D, however, offers a different dimension to the climate change discussion. While recognizing the political and moral reasons driving the debate around compensation, an increased focus on the complex and possibly unsolvable attribution question might put on hold efforts to integrate adaptation to climate change with wider development aims and DRR, blocking necessary action.","[Surminski, Swenja; Lopez, Ana] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lopez, A (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.lopez@lse.ac.uk,,"Surminski, Swenja/0000-0003-1270-5545",LSE's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment; ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy - Economic and Social Research Council; Munich Re.; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,LSE's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment; ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy - Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Munich Re.; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research was supported by the LSE's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and Munich Re.",,73,31,32,58,198,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The inter-dynamics between climate change and ports can also significantly diversify in different geographical regions. Consequently, risk and cost data used to support climate adaptation is of high uncertainty and in many occasions, real data is often unavailable and incomplete. This paper presents a risk and cost evaluation methodology that can be applied to the analysis of port climate change adaptation measures in situations where data uncertainty is high. Risk and cost criteria are used in a decision-making model for the selection of climate adaptation measures. Information produced using a fuzzy-Bayesian risk analysis approach is utilized to evaluate risk reduction outcomes from the use of adaptation measures in ports. An evidential reasoning approach is then employed to synthesize the risk reduction data as inputs to the decision-making model. The results can assist policymakers in developing efficient adaptation measures that take into account the reduction in the likelihood of risks, their possible consequences, their timeframe, and costs incurred. A technical study across 14 major container ports in Greater China is presented to demonstrate the interaction between cost and risk analysis, and to highlight the applicability of the stated methodology in practice. The paper offers a useful analytical tool for assessing climate change risks to ports and selecting the most cost-effective adaptation measures in uncertain conditions. It can also be used to compare the practitioners' perceptions of climate risks across different geographical regions, and to evaluate improvements after implementation of the selected adaptation measures with potential budgetary constraints. The methodology, together with the illustrative cases, provides important insights on how to develop efficient climate change adaptation measures in a supply chain context to improve the sustainability of development and enhance adaptation measures for ports, port cities, intermodal transport, supply chains, and urban and regional planning in general.

The adverse effects of climate change have just begun to be experienced in Turkey's spring and the winter wheat zones. However, climate change is likely to affect the winter wheat zone more severely. Fortunately, there is a fast, repeatable, reliable and relatively affordable way to predict climate change effects on winter wheat (e.g., testing winter wheat in the spring wheat zone). For this purpose, 36 wheat genotypes in total, consisting of 14 spring and 22 winter types, were tested under the field conditions of the Southeastern Anatolia Region, a representative of the spring wheat zone of Turkey, during the two cropping seasons (2017-2018 and 2019-2020). Simultaneous heat (>30 degrees C) and drought (<40 mm) stresses occurring in May and June during both growing seasons caused drastic losses in winter wheat grain yield and its components. Declines in plant characteristics of winter wheat genotypes, compared to those of spring wheat genotypes using as a control treatment, were determined as follows: 46.3% in grain yield, 23.7% in harvest index, 30.5% in grains per spike and 19.4% in thousand kernel weight, whereas an increase of 282.2% in spike sterility occurred. On the other hand, no substantial changes were observed in plant height (10 cm longer than that of spring wheat) and on days to heading (25 days more than that of spring wheat) of winter wheat genotypes. In general, taller winter wheat genotypes tended to lodge. Meanwhile, it became impossible to avoid the combined effects of heat and drought stresses during anthesis and grain filling periods because the time to heading of winter wheat genotypes could not be shortened significantly. In conclusion, our research findings showed that many winter wheat genotypes would not successfully adapt to climate change. It was determined that specific plant characteristics such as vernalization requirement, photoperiod sensitivity, long phenological duration (lack of earliness per se) and vulnerability to diseases prevailing in the spring wheat zone, made winter wheat difficult to adapt to climate change. The most important strategic step that can be taken to overcome these challenges is that Turkey's wheat breeding program objectives should be harmonized with the climate change scenarios.","[Kaya, Yuksel] Siirt Univ, Dept Crop Sci, Fac Agr, TR-56100 Siirt, Turkey",Siirt University,"Kaya, Y (corresponding author), Siirt Univ, Dept Crop Sci, Fac Agr, TR-56100 Siirt, Turkey.",y.kaya@siirt.edu.tr,,"KAYA, YUKSEL/0000-0003-3969-3097",,,,,77,6,6,2,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,APR,2021,11,4,,,,,,,689,10.3390/agronomy11040689,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11040689,,,20,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,RQ8PI,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000642675300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We address this issue using the case of the Northern Hesse region located in the centre of Germany by developing a spatially explicit, multi-agent simulation model. Agents are grouped according to their social stratification by lifestyle and initialised by large scale, spatially explicit socio-empirical data. One important adaptation requirement will be volunteering activities that provide local neighbourhood support to supplement public health care during heat waves. We present modelling results on this topic and demonstrate how simulations may support the formation of health policies. As a result, we identify (areas with) populations with low potential for self-organised neighbourhood assistance and those with potentially efficient neighbourhood support. Furthermore, we investigate two different intervention scenarios that aim to mobilise passive subpopulations.

A major roadblock to implementing climate change adaptation measures is poor governance. Given their experience with governing organizations, farmers are highly suitable to assess the appropriateness of different governing organizations to implement adaptation measures on the ground. We surveyed 283 farmers in Makueni County in Kenya applying the choice experiment method to assess their preferences in relation to different attributes of a sand storage dam project - including the organization governing the dam construction. We find that farmers prefer an NGO as the governing organization, followed closely by a farmer network and, with some distance, a government institution. For the whole of Makueni County, we find that benefits of $ 320,426 are lost if farmer networks are the governing organizations instead of NGOs and $ 1,779,596 if government institutions govern the dam construction instead of NGOs. On a methodological level, our study contributes to improving the application of choice experiments in developing countries as it draws attention to the importance of carefully selecting the payment vehicle for successful project implementation.","[Nthambi, Mary; Markova-Nenova, Nonka; Waetzold, Frank] Brandenburg Univ Technol Cottbus Senftenberg, Dept Environm Econ, Postbox 101344, D-03013 Cottbus, Germany",Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus,"Nthambi, M (corresponding author), Brandenburg Univ Technol Cottbus Senftenberg, Dept Environm Econ, Postbox 101344, D-03013 Cottbus, Germany.",mnthambi2019@gmail.com; markova@b-tu.de; waetzold@b-tu.de,"Watzold, Frank/F-3122-2015","Watzold, Frank/0000-0002-4664-0113; NTHAMBI, MARY/0000-0002-7036-979X; Markova-Nenova, Nonka/0000-0003-4310-4128",Catholic Academic Exchange Service (Katholischer Akademischer AuslanderDienst (KAAD)); Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus-Senftenberg,Catholic Academic Exchange Service (Katholischer Akademischer AuslanderDienst (KAAD)); Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus-Senftenberg,We are grateful to participants of the research seminar at the Department of Environmental Economics who provided valuable comments to earlier drafts of the paper.

Achieving the SDGs will be furthered by the closer integration of the climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR) agendas. Gender provides us a valuable portal for considering this integration. Acknowledging that gender relaters to both women and men and that men and women experience climate variability and disasters differently, in this paper the role of women in both CCA and DRR is explored, shifting the focus from women as vulnerable victims to women as critical agents for change with respect to climate change mitigation and adaptation and reduction of disaster risks.

A participatory action research project conducted in Victoria, Australia, examined how health and social service organisations developed their organisational adaptive capacity through the use of adaptation decision-support tools. It can be challenging for any organisation to select and apply a decision-support tool, but this is particularly the case where resources and capacities are limited. For most organisations, climate change is only one of a complex set of dynamic stressors they must consider in meeting organisational goals. This paper shows that while decision-support tools can help co-generate knowledge and facilitate customised organisational adaptation processes, for them to be practically helpful for organisations with limited resources and capacities, intensive collaborative and discursive processes are needed to adjust such tools to fit specific organisational contexts and needs. Facilitators and participatory approaches that enable co-inquiry can play a critical role in supplementing scarce resources and initiating adaptation processes that go well beyond the scope and purpose of the decision-support tool used. Organisations working effectively with decision-support tools to adapt to climate change will need to feel ownership of them and have confidence in modifying them to suit their particular adaptation needs and organisational goals.","[Fuenfgeld, Hartmut] RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Fuenfgeld, Hartmut] Univ Freiburg, Inst Environm Social Sci & Geog, Schreiberstr 20, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany; [Lonsdale, Kate] IOD PARC, 362 Cemetery Rd, Sheffield S11 8FT, S Yorkshire, England; [Bosomworth, Karyn] RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Ctr Urban Res, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); University of Freiburg; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Funfgeld, H (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.;Funfgeld, H (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Environm Social Sci & Geog, Schreiberstr 20, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",hartmut.fuenfgeld@geographie.uni-freiburg.de,"Bosomworth, Karyn/A-6435-2016; Fünfgeld, Hartmut/X-8504-2019","Bosomworth, Karyn/0000-0001-9907-0858; Fünfgeld, Hartmut/0000-0003-0359-8207",Victorian Government (Australia) through the Victorian Centre for Climate Change Adaptation Research (VCCCAR),Victorian Government (Australia) through the Victorian Centre for Climate Change Adaptation Research (VCCCAR),The research received funding from the Victorian Government (Australia) through the Victorian Centre for Climate Change Adaptation Research (VCCCAR).,,64,5,5,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

This paper aims to assess whether or not administrative traditions matter for the formation of national climate change adaptation policy in 32 high-income countries. We operationalize administrative traditions based on five structural criteria: vertical dispersion of authority, horizontal coordination, interest mediation between state-society, role of public administrator, and how ideas enter bureaucracy. We construct a unique adaptation policy dataset that includes 32 high-income countries to test seven hypotheses. Our results indicate that countries' adaptation policies align to some extent with their administrative structure, particularly dispersion of authority and horizontal coordination. However, we find limited evidence that other public bureaucracy factors are related to national adaptation policy. We conclude that administrative traditions matter, but that their influence should not be overestimated.","[Biesbroek, Robbert] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lesnikowski, Alexandra] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Ford, James D.] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Climate Adaptat, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Berrang-Ford, Lea] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Climate & Hlth, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Vink, Martinus] Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy PBL, The Hague, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; McGill University; University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Biesbroek, R (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands.",robbert.biesbroek@wur.nl,"Biesbroek, Robbert/GZZ-4476-2022; Biesbroek, Robbert/ABE-3686-2021; Ford, James/A-4284-2013","Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419; Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419; Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456","COST Action INOGOV (IS1309 Innovations in Climate Governance: Sources, Patterns and Effects; 2014-18)","COST Action INOGOV (IS1309 Innovations in Climate Governance: Sources, Patterns and Effects; 2014-18)(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST))","This article benefitted from comments received from the participants of the INOGOV Intensive Research Workshop Administrative Traditions and Climate Change Adaptation held in Amsterdam on April 19-20, 2016.

This makes it a focus of numerous policies for increased productivity and climate change adaptation. Given demographic and economic processes that are likely to reduce smallholder prevalence, how justified is this focus from a long-term perspective? We estimate future global smallholder distributions using historical trends and demographic projections and calculate indices of its future share of climate change impacts. While past trends of decreasing farm size are likely to reverse in Asia and slow down in Africa, we project smallholders will continue to occupy substantial shares of rural populations and cultivated land and bear a sizable portion of climate change impacts, amounting for about 33% (25%) of an index of human exposure to 1 degrees C (2 degrees C) warming.

It explores whether adoption of CD is a win-win strategy on household income and demand for on-farm labor. It also examines the determinants of rural household's net farm income and family labor demand. Design/methodology/approach - A household-plot level data were collected in 2015 from 929 rural farm households and 4,778 plots in the Nile Basin of Ethiopia. The data comprise farm and household characteristics accompanied by geo-referenced climate data such as long-term average temperature and amount and variability of growing season rainfall. The authors estimate an endogenous switching regression model to measure the effect of CD on the farm household's welfare, using net farm income and household labor demand as a welfare indicator. Findings - The results indicate heterogeneous effects of climate variables on farm income between adopters and non-adopters of CD. The study also confirms the win-win effect of adoption of CD with a positive and significant effect on farm income and a reduction in demand for on-farm labor. The results suggest that adoption of CD helps improve the well-being of farm households and build a resilient agricultural system. Research limitations/implications - As the study used a cross-sectional data, it is limited to show the time effect of practicing CD on the household's welfare. Originality/value - First, the authors investigate, to their knowledge for the first time, the existence of synergy or tradeoff in the effect of CD on two dimensions of rural households' welfare (net farm income and labor demand). Second, they investigate the heterogeneous effect of climate change adaptation strategies on the farm household's welfare between adopters and non-adopters. This is unlike previous studies that consider climate change adaptation strategies as having a homogeneous effect. However, this approach is inappropriate since the effect of adaptation strategies is different for adopters and non-adopters.","[Asmare, Fissha] Debre Berihan Univ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Teklewold, Hailemariam] ECRC, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Mekonnen, Alemu] Addis Ababa Univ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Asmare, F (corresponding author), Debre Berihan Univ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",fish.asmare@gmail.com,"Marye, Fissha/ABJ-4291-2022","Marye, FISSHA/0000-0003-0101-8555",International Development Research Centre (IDRC) under the project Adaptation to Increase Resilience to Climate Change in Ethiopian Agriculture [107745-001],International Development Research Centre (IDRC) under the project Adaptation to Increase Resilience to Climate Change in Ethiopian Agriculture,This study was financed by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) under the project Adaptation to Increase Resilience to Climate Change in Ethiopian Agriculture (IDRC Project Number: 107745-001).

Much is known about the impacts of climate change on the crop enterprises in the mixed systems, and some, although less, on the livestock enterprises. The interactions between crops and livestock can be managed to contribute to environmentally sustainable intensification, diversification and risk management. There is relatively little information on how these interactions may be affected by changes in climate and climate variability. This is a serious gap, because these interactions may offer some buffering capacity to help smallholders adapt to climate change.","[Thornton, Philip K.] ILRI, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Thornton, Philip K.; Herrero, Mario] CSIRO, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Thornton, PK (corresponding author), ILRI, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, POB 30709, Nairobi 00100, Kenya.",p.thornton@cgiar.org,"Herrero, Mario/A-6678-2015; Thornton, Philip/AAB-8806-2020","Herrero, Mario/0000-0002-7741-5090; Thornton, Philip/0000-0002-1854-0182","CCAFS; CSIRO McMaster Research Fellowship; CGIAR Fund; AusAid; Danish International Development Agency; Environment Canada; Instituto de Investigacao Cientifica Tropical; Irish Aid; Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, Government of Russia, UK; European Union","CCAFS; CSIRO McMaster Research Fellowship; CGIAR Fund(CGIAR); AusAid(Australian Aid (AusAID)); Danish International Development Agency; Environment Canada(CGIAR); Instituto de Investigacao Cientifica Tropical; Irish Aid(CGIAR); Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, Government of Russia, UK; European Union(European Commission)","P.K.T. acknowledges the support of CCAFS and a CSIRO McMaster Research Fellowship.

These agendas are more outcome-oriented with monitoring mechanisms than previous ones and require a coher-ent multi-stakeholder, cross-sectoral approach across government levels. Above all, the global indicators for monitoring the Sendai Framework have been adopted as SDG indicators in Goals 1, 11, and 13. Interlink-ages between DRR, climate change, and sustainable development are observed from the integrated moni-toring of agendas, which enhances coordination and coherence. Disaggregated data have revealed that ma-jor disaster mortality and economic losses in recent years have been triggered by weather-, climate-, and water-related disasters. More detailed data support evidence-based policymaking and promote coherence. To achieve Target E of the Sendai Framework, coun-tries are developing DRR strategies to promote policy coherence with sustainable development and climate change. Both the number of national DRR strategies and alignment scores have increased over the years. DRR strategies and national adaptation plans (NAPs) should adopt a risk-informed, integrated approach to sustainable development through comprehensive planning and implementation. To achieve disaster re-silience, national plans in these domains should be bet-ter integrated to maximize the effectiveness of actions toward disaster resilience and passed on to the sub -national level for implementation as place-based poli-cies. Japanese experiences toward disaster resilience highlight interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary ap-proaches by various stakeholders with technological innovation, which presents promising progress.","[Yamazaki-Honda, Ritsuko] Natl Res Inst Earth Sci & Disaster Resilience NIED, 3-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050006, Japan",,"Yamazaki-Honda, R (corresponding author), Natl Res Inst Earth Sci & Disaster Resilience NIED, 3-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050006, Japan.",r-yamazaki@bosai.go.jp,,,,,,,38,0,0,6,6,FUJI TECHNOLOGY PRESS LTD,TOKYO,"1-15-7, UCHIKANDA, CHIYODA-KU, UNIZO UCHIKANDA 1-CHOME BLDG 2F, TOKYO, 101-0047, JAPAN",1881-2473,1883-8030,,J DISASTER RES,J.

Stakeholder risk perceptions are a key factor in adaptation to climate change because they fundamentally drive or constrain stakeholder action. This paper examines climate change perceptions of winter tourism stakeholders in Tyrol (Austria). Using a qualitative approach, expert interviews were conducted. Four opinion categories reflecting different attitudes toward climate change issues were identified: convinced planners, annoyed deniers, ambivalent optimists, convinced wait-and-seers. Although the findings generally indicate a growing awareness of climate change, this awareness is mainly limited to perceiving the issue as a global phenomenon. Awareness of regional and branch-specific consequences of climate change that lead to a demand for action could not be identified. Current technical strategies, like snowmaking, are not primarily climate-induced. At present, coping with climate change is not a priority for risk management. The findings point out the importance of gaining and transferring knowledge of regional and branch-specific consequences of climate change in order to induce action at the destination level.

In this review paper, we provide a brief overview of one major endorheic basin on each continent, plus a number of endorheic basins in Central Asia (CA), a region where a large proportion of the land area is within this type of basin. We summarize the effects of (changing) climate drivers and land surface-atmosphere feedbacks on the water balance. For the CA region, we also discuss key anthropogenic activities, related water management approaches and their complex relationship with political and policy issues. In CA a substantial increase in irrigated agriculture coupled with negative climate change impacts have disrupted the fragile water balance for many endorheic basins and their lakes. Transboundary integrated land and water management approaches must be developed to facilitate adequate climate change adaptation and possible mitigation of the adverse anthropogenic influence on endorheic basins in CA. Suitable climate adaptation, mitigation and efficient natural resource management technologies and methods are available, and are developing fast. A number of these are discussed in the paper, but these technologies alone are not sufficient to address pressing water resource issues in CA. Food-water-energy nexus analyses demonstrate that transboundary endorheic basin management requires transformational changes with involvement of all key stakeholders. Regional programs, supported by local governments and international donors, which incorporate advanced adaptation technologies, water resource research and management capacity development, are essential for successful climate change adaptation efforts in CA. However, there is a need for an accelerated uptake of such programs, with an emphasis on unification of approaches, as the pressures resulting from climate change and aggravated by human mismanagement of natural water resources leave very little time for hesitation.","[Yapiyev, Vadim; Sagintayev, Zhanay] Nazarbayev Univ, Sch Engn, Astana 010000, Kazakhstan; [Yapiyev, Vadim] Nazarbayev Univ, Natl Lab Astana, Astana 010000, Kazakhstan; [Inglezakis, Vassilis J.] Nazarbayev Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Chem Engn, Environm Sci & Technol Grp ESTg, Astana 010000, Kazakhstan; [Samarkhanov, Kanat] Chinese Acad Sci, XinJiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Verhoef, Anne] Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading RG6 6AB, Berks, England","Nazarbayev University; Nazarbayev University; Nazarbayev University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xinjiang Institute of Ecology & Geography, CAS; University of Reading","Yapiyev, V (corresponding author), Nazarbayev Univ, Sch Engn, Astana 010000, Kazakhstan.;Yapiyev, V (corresponding author), Nazarbayev Univ, Natl Lab Astana, Astana 010000, Kazakhstan.",vyapiyev@nu.edu.kz; zhanay.sagintayev@nu.edu.kz; vasileios.inglezakis@nu.edu.kz; skgeo@mail.ru; a.verhoef@reading.ac.uk,"Sagin, Jay/F-7522-2013; Inglezakis, Vassilis/F-8554-2013; Yapiyev, Vadim R/U-9460-2017; Verhoef, Anne/W-2045-2018; Samarkhanov, Kanat/S-2590-2017","Sagin, Jay/0000-0002-0386-888X; Inglezakis, Vassilis/0000-0002-0195-0417; Yapiyev, Vadim R/0000-0001-8090-5122; Verhoef, Anne/0000-0002-9498-6696; Samarkhanov, Kanat/0000-0001-9799-8695","Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan [0115RK03041]; project, Climate Change, Water Resources and Food Security in Kazakhstan (CCKAZ) - United Kingdom's Newton Fund Institutional Links Programme [172722855]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1603242]; USAID PEER; UK Royal Academy of Engineers; Nazarbayev University; The British Council [172722855] Funding Source: researchfish","Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan(Government of the Republic of KazakhstanMinistry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan); project, Climate Change, Water Resources and Food Security in Kazakhstan (CCKAZ) - United Kingdom's Newton Fund Institutional Links Programme; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); USAID PEER(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); UK Royal Academy of Engineers; Nazarbayev University; The British Council","This research was supported under the target program No. 0115RK03041 Research and development in the fields of energy efficiency and energy saving, renewable energy sources, and environmental protection for years 2014-2016 from the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

Understanding climate change impacts on global potato yields is therefore important for future food security. Analyses of climate change impacts on potato compared to other major crops are rare, especially at the global scale. Of two global gridded potato modeling studies published at the time of this analysis, one simulated the impacts of temperature increases on potential potato yields; the other did not simulate the impacts of farmer adaptation to climate change, which may offset negative climate change impacts on yield. These studies may therefore overestimate negative climate change impacts on yields as they do not simultaneously include CO2 fertilisation and adaptation to climate change. Here we simulate the abiotic impacts of climate change on potato to 2050 using the GLAM crop model and the ISI-MIP ensemble of global climate models. Simulations include adaptations to climate change through varying planting windows and varieties and CO2 fertilisation, unlike previous global potato modeling studies. Results show significant skill in reproducing observed national scale yields in Europe. Elsewhere, correlations are generally positive but low, primarily due to poor relationships between national scale observed yields and climate. Future climate simulations including adaptation to climate change through changing planting windows and crop varieties show that yields are expected to increase in most cases as a result of longer growing seasons and CO2 fertilisation. Average global yield increases range from 9 to 20% when including adaptation. The global average yield benefits of adaptation to climate change range from 10 to 17% across climate models. Potato agriculture is associated with lower green house gas emissions relative to other major crops and therefore can be seen as a climate smart option given projected yield increases with adaptation.","[Jennings, Stewart A.; Koehler, Ann-Kristin; Nicklin, Kathryn J.; Deva, Chetan; Challinor, Andrew J.] Univ Leeds, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Sait, Steven M.] Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Fac Biol Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Jennings, SA (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",s.a.jennings@leeds.ac.uk,,,Natural Environment Research Council [NE/L501542/1]; NERC [NE/L501542/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),This work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council [grant number NE/L501542/1.].,,123,12,12,8,33,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2571-581X,,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

The most adopted adaptation strategies were intercropping, fallowing, fertilizer application, and crop rotation. Most of the households had moderate or high adaptive capacity to climate change.

However, there is a lack of on-the-ground forest adaptation research to indicate what adaptation measures or tactics might be effective in preparing forest ecosystems to deal with climate change. Natural resource managers in many areas are also challenged by scant locally or regionally relevant information on climate projections and potential impacts. The Adaptive Silviculture for Climate Change (ASCC) project was designed to respond to these barriers to operationalizing climate adaptation strategies by providing a multiregion network of replicated opeiational-scale research sites testing ecosystem-specific climate change adaptation treatments across a gradient of adaptive approaches, and introducing conceptual tools and processes to integrate climate change considerations into management and silvicultural decisionmaking. Here we present the framework of the ASCC project, highlight the implementation process at two of the study sites, and discuss the contributions of this collaborative science-management partnership.","[Nagel, Linda M.; Roske, Molly R.] Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Palik, Brian J.; Battaglia, Michael A.; Guldin, James M.; Joyce, Linda A.; Millar, Constance I.; Ganio, Lisa M.; Kirschbaum, Chad] US Forest Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [D'Amato, Anthony W.] Univ Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Swanston, Christopher W.; Janowiak, Maria K.] US Forest Serv, Northern Inst Appl Climate Sci, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Powers, Matthew P.] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Peterson, David L.] Pacific Northwest Res Stn, Portland, OR USA",Colorado State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; University of Vermont; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Oregon State University,"Nagel, LM (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",linda.nagel@colostate.edu; bpalik@fs.fed.us; mbattaglia@fs.fed.us; awdamato@uvm.edu; jguldin@fs.fed.us; cswanston@fs.fed.us; mjanowiak02@fs.fed.us; matthew.powers@oregonstate.edu; ljoyce@fs.fed.us; cmillar@fs.fed.us; peterson@fs.fed.us; lisa.ganio@oregonstate.edu; ckirschbaum@fs.fed.us; molly.roske@colostate.edu,"D'Amato, Anthony/AAV-3245-2021","D'Amato, Anthony/0000-0002-2570-4376; Battaglia, Michael/0000-0002-4260-5804; Palik, Brian/0000-0003-0300-9644; Swanston, Chris/0000-0003-2167-0970",USDA Forest Service Southern Research Station; Northern Research Station; Northern Institute of Applied Climate Science; Rocky Mountain Research Station; Michigan Technological University; University of Minnesota; Colorado State University; Department of Interior Northeast Climate Science Center,USDA Forest Service Southern Research Station(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); Northern Research Station(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); Northern Institute of Applied Climate Science; Rocky Mountain Research Station(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); Michigan Technological University; University of Minnesota(University of Minnesota System); Colorado State University; Department of Interior Northeast Climate Science Center,"The Adaptive Silviculture for Climate Change project has been supported in large part by a grant from the USDA Forest Service Southern Research Station to develop and implement the framework.

This acknowledgement has increased interest in understanding social and institutional networks for climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR). In this study, we used Social Network Analysis (SNA) to explore institutional interactions within and across the communities of the aforementioned domains in Europe. Firstly, we investigated the type and intensity of interactions. We calculated SNA metrics to assess the roles of different actors and applied cluster analysis to identify actors with similar patterns of connections. SNA showed that communication is often more intensive within the two communities, while collaboration is frequent around topics related to both CCA and DRR. Cluster analysis revealed that actors tied with DRR were more closely connected, while actors tied with CCA and those with mixed connections showed no obvious clustering affinity. The European Climate Adaptation Platform, Climate-ADAPT, had the highest value for various SNA metrics, reflecting its popularity in the network and its potential for enhancing interactions among its actors. Finally, SNA was complemented by qualitative interviews, which emphasised the importance of connecting CCA and DRR in organisational mission and vision statements.","[Karali, Eleni] Hellen Minist Environm & Energy, Athens 11251, Greece; [Karali, Eleni; Bojovic, Dragana; Giupponi, Carlo] Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, I-30175 Venice, Italy; [Bojovic, Dragana] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr BSC CNS, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Michalek, Gabriela; Schwarze, Reimund] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Giupponi, Carlo] Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Dipartimento Econ, I-30121 Venice, Italy",Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC-CNS); Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Karali, E (corresponding author), Hellen Minist Environm & Energy, Athens 11251, Greece.;Karali, E (corresponding author), Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, I-30175 Venice, Italy.",ekarali8@gmail.com; dragunlija@gmail.com; gabriela.michalek@ufz.de; cgiupponi@unive.it; reimund.schwarze@ufz.de,,"BOJOVIC, Dragana/0000-0001-7354-1885; Schwarze, Reimund/0000-0002-2734-9259",European Union [653255],European Union(European Commission),"The research presented in this paper was conducted in the context of the PLACARD project (Grant agreement No. 653255), funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research & Innovation Framework programme.

ILK may assist efforts to address climate change challenges in Africa and make subsequent decisions regarding climate adaptation. Purpose: The article documents evidence of the ILK's potential in reducing vulnerability to climate change and/or improving the resilience of communities. The study also reflects on major barriers that hinder the improved mainstreaming of ILK into adaptation strategies. Methods and approach: The present study uses two main methods: a literature review and a presentation of case studies from a sample of African countries where ILK informs adaptation options, including indigenous land-tenure practices and weather prediction. The selected case studies highlight the historical legacy of ILK and its effectiveness in reducing vulnerability and the impacts of climate change. Findings: The results indicate that, despite being acknowledged as a valuable resource for climate adaptation, current national adaptation policies on the African continent still show serious gaps in effectively integrating ILK systems within the legal frameworks to reduce vulnerability. Policy implications: ILK should be better integrated with modern climate change adaptation strategies to anticipate more effective responses. Both rural communities and relevant government agencies should complement the use of ILK with climate change strategies, so as to maximize its contribution to the effective implementation of climate change policies.","[Filho, Walter Leal] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Int Climate Change Informat & Res Programme, Hamburg, Germany; [Filho, Walter Leal] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Nat Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Wolf, Franziska] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, European Sch Sustainabil Sci & Res, Ulmenliet 20, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany; [Totin, Edmond] Univ Natl Agr Benin, Ecole Foresterie Trop, Ketou, Benin; [Zvobgo, Luckson] Univ Cape Town, Climate Syst Anal Grp CSAG, Cape Town, South Africa; [Simpson, Nicholas Philip] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa; [Musiyiwa, Kumbirai] Chinhoyi Univ Technol, Sch Agr Sci, Dept Crop Sci & Postharvest Technol, Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe; [Kalangu, Jokastah W.] South Eastern Kenya Univ, Sch Water Resource Sci Technol, Nairobi, Kenya; [Sanni, Maruf] Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Natl Ctr Technol Management, Fed Minist Sci & Technol, Ife, Nigeria; [Adelekan, Ibidun] Univ Ibadan, Fac Social Sci, Dept Geog, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Efitre, Jackson] Makerere Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Dept Zool Entomol & Fisheries Sci, Kampala, Uganda; [Donkor, Felix Kwabena] Univ Educ, Fac Geog Educ, Winneba, Ghana; [Balogun, Abdul-Lateef] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Geospatial Anal & Modelling Res GAMR Grp, Seri Iskandar, Perak, Malaysia; [Mucova, Serafino Afonso Rui] Lurio Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Nampula, Mozambique; [Ayal, Desalegn Yayeh] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Ctr Food Secur Studies CFSS, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Hochschule Angewandte Wissenschaft Hamburg; Manchester Metropolitan University; Hochschule Angewandte Wissenschaft Hamburg; University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town; Obafemi Awolowo University; University of Ibadan; Makerere University; Universiti Teknologi Petronas; Addis Ababa University,"Wolf, F (corresponding author), Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, European Sch Sustainabil Sci & Res, Ulmenliet 20, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany.",franziska.wolf@haw-hamburg.de,"Simpson, Nicholas/AAC-4578-2022; Sanni, Maruf/AAH-4957-2019","Simpson, Nicholas/0000-0002-9041-982X; Sanni, Maruf/0000-0001-8313-9910","UK government's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada [109419-001]; International Climate Change Information and Research Programme; Projekt DEAL","UK government's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada(CGIAR); International Climate Change Information and Research Programme; Projekt DEAL","N.P.S. received financial support from the UK government's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office and the International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada (Grant number 109419-001).

Attention to adaptation focuses on reduction of climate change vulnerability and increase of adaptive capacity. In order to better understand the role of decision-making in urban forestry, this paper assesses the perceptions of urban forestry stakeholders towards climate change adaptation, in the city of Belgrade (Serbia), based on Q-method interviews. The views of respondents were clustered into three distinct perspectives: (a) 'Management-oriented perspective', (b) 'Sceptics', (c) 'General-awareness perspective'. Overall, a majority of interviewees (50%) are allocated to group (a), about a third to group (c), and only a minority (15%) to group (b). The sceptics' perspective holds the opinion that climate variations are normal and there is insufficient evidence to prove the existence of climate change. Representatives of the two other perspectives recognize climate change as a challenge, but adopt different opinions to communication and coordination of the adaptation process. While the 'Management-oriented perspective' is advocating for more bottom-up initiatives and improvement of dialogue between stakeholders, the 'General-awareness perspective' opine that climate change is an issue to be governed by the national level organizations. Through these three varied perspectives, the main factors for the current lack of responses to climate change adaptation and related needs in urban forestry are identified: lack of coordination and communication between stakeholders, lack of scale-relevant technical and scientific data, lack of specific regulations and financial means. To move forward, we recommend empowering various stakeholders, improving organizational relations and introducing various means of education and information-sharing mechanisms.

An increase in extreme weather events underscores the importance of bringing coherence in efforts to reduce the risk of disasters and to adapt to the impacts of the changing climate. The linkages between disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) and the need to integrate the two policy areas are well documented in the literature. However, the implementation of DRR and CCA measures continues in isolation. This article seeks to contribute to the ongoing efforts to bring coherence between DRR and CCA by identifying factors that would make it easy to integrate the two policy areas. An exploratory-sequential mixed methods design was used to collect data from 41 participants from 10 of the 16 SADC Member States and two international cooperating partners. Participants identified political will and commitment, policy and legislative frameworks, provision of resources and capacities, addressing institutional barriers, and an improvement in communication and coordination as the main factors that could enhance the integration of government organizations for DRR and CCA. This paper submits that successful integration of institutions responsible for DRR and CCA, particularly government institutions, can be achieved when these factors are addressed.","[Nemakonde, Livhuwani D.; Van Niekerk, Dewald] North West Univ, African Ctr Disaster Studies, Sch Geo & Spatial Sci, Unit Environm Sci & Management, 11 Hoffman St, ZA-2531 Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Nemakonde, LD (corresponding author), North West Univ, African Ctr Disaster Studies, Sch Geo & Spatial Sci, Unit Environm Sci & Management, 11 Hoffman St, ZA-2531 Potchefstroom, South Africa.",livhuwani.nemakonde@acds.co.za,"Nemakonde, Livhuwani/AAE-6439-2020; van Niekerk, Dewald/H-6134-2012","Nemakonde, Livhuwani/0000-0002-3458-5575; van Niekerk, Dewald/0000-0002-4571-4205",,,,,61,0,0,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-4079,,,RISK HAZARDS CRISIS,Risk Hazards Crisis Public Policy,MAR,2023,14,1,,,,,6,26,,10.1002/rhc3.12246,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rhc3.12246,,MAR 2022,21,Public Administration,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Public Administration,9M0LP,,hybrid,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000765237500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Decision analysis embraces uncertainty through an interdisciplinary approach that involves relevant stakeholders in evaluating complex decisions. We applied decision analysis approaches to prioritize 21 farm management interventions, which could be considered in certification schemes for banana production. We estimated their contribution to climate change adaptation and mitigation as well as ecological outcomes. We used a general model that estimated the impacts of each intervention on adaptation (benefits minus costs), mitigation (global warming potential), ecological parameters (e.g., biodiversity and water and soil quality), and farming aspects (e.g., yield, implementation costs and production risks). We used expert and documented knowledge and presented uncertainties in the form of 90% confidence intervals to feed the model and forecast the changes in system outcomes caused by each intervention compared to a baseline scenario without the measure. By iterating the model function 10,000 times, we obtained probability distributions for each of the outcomes and farm management interventions. Our results suggest that interventions associated with nutrient management (e.g., composting and nutrient management plan) positively affect climate change adaptation, mitigation, and ecological aspects. Measures with no direct yield benefits (e.g., plastic reduction) correlate negatively with adaptation but have positive impacts on ecology. Creating buffer zones and converting low-productivity farmland (incl. unused land) also have positive ecological and adaptation outcomes. Decision analysis can help in prioritizing farm management interventions, which may vary considerably in their relationship with the expected outcomes. Additional work may be required to elaborate a comprehensive assessment of the underlying aspects modulating the impacts of a given measure on the evaluated outcome. Our analysis provides insights on the most promising interventions for banana plantations and may help practitioners and researchers in focusing further studies.","[Fernandez, Eduardo; Do, Hoa; Luedeling, Eike; Luu, Thi Thu Giang; Whitney, Cory] Univ Bonn, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat INRES, Dept Hort Sci, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Fernandez, Eduardo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Agron, Casilla 4-D, Quillota, Chile",University of Bonn; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso,"Whitney, C (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat INRES, Dept Hort Sci, D-53121 Bonn, Germany.",coly.whitney@uni-bonn.de,"Luu, Thi Thu Giang/AAM-3615-2020; Fernandez, Eduardo/V-3324-2019; Whitney, Cory/I-2379-2015","Luu, Thi Thu Giang/0000-0002-3538-5209; Fernandez, Eduardo/0000-0002-6949-9685; Whitney, Cory/0000-0003-4988-4583; Do, Hoa/0000-0001-8129-8803",German Corporation for International Cooperation (GIZ) [16.2190.3-014.00]; Projekt DEAL,German Corporation for International Cooperation (GIZ); Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

SIDS are thus also among the first to adapt, and as 'early adaptors' can provide key lessons for adaptation efforts elsewhere. This article reviews the growing literature on climate change, adaptation and small island states. It first discusses migration - which increasingly is seen as part of adaptation rather than a failure to adapt. Mobility has long been part of island life, and remittances can for example fund adaptation measures back home. Yet, adaptation in situ is not as forthcoming as would be necessary. The article identifies different barriers to effective adaptation, and discusses them under three distinct but interrelated categories: perceptions and awareness, institutions, and (lack of) resources. For effective, sustainable and successful adaptation, we need to overcome these barriers, and in particular provide information and resources to the local level. With appropriate information and resources, island communities can take and implement informed decisions and successfully adapt to a changing climate - as they have adjusted to social and environmental changes in the past.","[Betzold, Carola] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Betzold, C (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.",carola.betzold@gu.se,,"Klock, Carola/0000-0003-2987-7570",,,,,43,98,99,5,96,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Rice-Wheat cropping zone is one of the prone regions that use water coming from upstream of the Indus Basin in Pakistan. In this study Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to evaluate the climate change adaptation practices in agriculture. The model was calibrated for the years 2005-2010 at Tarbela and Mangla reservoirs. Reasonably good performance of the calibrated model was achieved by estimated Coefficient of Determination (R-2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Percent Bias (PBIAS) at 0.87, 0.82 and 10.7 % for Tarbela and 0.70, 0.72 and 15.7 % for Mangla, respectively. Direct-Seeded Rice (DSR) practice for rice and Zero Tillage practice for wheat crops were tested in comparison to conventional methods by using SWAT. In parallel to the modeling approach, the field experiment was performed for two years i.e 2016-17 and-2017-18 at district Sahiwal. The results showed that overall water productivity of DSR was 0.58 and 0.54 kg per m(3) in the year 2017 and 2018, respectively, which was higher than Transplanting Rice Practice (TRP) having 0.43 and 0.40 kg per m(3) in 2017 and 2018, respectively. In wheat crop trails, overall water productivity of zero tillage was 1.3 and 1.2 kg per m(3) in the years 2017 and 2018, respectively. Two climate change scenarios Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 were tested in a combination of best management practices to evaluate climate change adaptation strategies for rice-wheat cropping zones. The results showed that DSR and Zero Tillage practices would be helpful in the future to adapt the expected climate change conditions without compromising the yield and water productivity of rice and wheat crops.","[Khan, Muhammad Mohsin; Cheema, Muhammad Jehanzeb Masud; Arshad, Muhammad] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Irrigat & Drainage, Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan; [Khan, Muhammad Mohsin] MNS Univ Agr, Dept Agr Engn, Multan, Punjab, Pakistan; [Cheema, Muhammad Jehanzeb Masud] PMAS Arid Agr Univ, Dept Land & Water Conservat Engn, Rawalpindi, Punjab, Pakistan; [Khaliq, Tasneem] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Agron, Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan",University of Agriculture Faisalabad; Arid Agriculture University; University of Agriculture Faisalabad,"Khan, MM (corresponding author), Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Irrigat & Drainage, Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan.;Khan, MM (corresponding author), MNS Univ Agr, Dept Agr Engn, Multan, Punjab, Pakistan.",mohsin.khan@mnsuam.edu.pk,"Khaliq, Tasneem/AAS-2143-2021; Khaliq, Tasneem/B-3603-2013; Cheema, Muhammad Jehanzeb Masud/Q-1001-2019","Khaliq, Tasneem/0000-0002-4616-8429; Khaliq, Tasneem/0000-0002-4616-8429; Cheema, Muhammad Jehanzeb Masud/0000-0002-7911-7548",,,,,30,0,0,0,15,"UNIV AGRICULTURE, FAC VETERINARY SCIENCE",FAISALABAD,"UNIV AGRICULTURE, FAC VETERINARY SCIENCE, FAISALABAD, 00000, PAKISTAN",0552-9034,2076-0906,,PAK J AGR SCI,Pak.

Flood risk is calculated as a function of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. The flood risk for a building was classified into five classes, and the distribution characteristics of buildings were examined according to England's flood risk vulnerability classification system, known as Planning Policy Statement 25 (PPS25). After analyzing the risk of flooding in Ulsan Metropolitan City, one of Korea's representative urban areas, it was found that while Dong-gu District can be considered relatively safe, districts of Jung-gu and Nam-gu, as well as Ulju-gun, have highly vulnerable buildings with red and orange ratings, which include motor vehicles-related facilities, education and welfare facilities, and residential facilities. There has been evidence to prove that urban flood disaster affects topography and the environment, in addition to having a significant effect on adaptability depending on the facility groups that resulted from urbanization. This study is expected to serve as a scientific database for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation to floods during land-use planning, which would eventually allow for systematic management of high-risk buildings through verification of location suitability of buildings by facility group.","[Yu, Insang] Korea Environm Inst, Korea Adaptat Ctr Climate Change, Sejong 30121, South Korea; [Park, Kiyong] Chungbuk Natl Univ, Dept Big Data, Cheongju 28644, South Korea; [Lee, Eui Hoon] Chungbuk Natl Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Cheongju 28644, South Korea",Korea Environment Institute (KEI); Chungbuk National University; Chungbuk National University,"Lee, EH (corresponding author), Chungbuk Natl Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Cheongju 28644, South Korea.",impressive1126@gmail.com; pky3489@chungbuk.ac.kr; hydrohydro@chungbuk.ac.kr,,"Yu, Insang/0000-0002-8127-4892; Lee, Eui Hoon/0000-0002-7596-3368",National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea [NRF-2019R1I1A3A01059929],National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),FundingThis research was funded by the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea (NRF-2019R1I1A3A01059929).,,39,0,0,14,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2021,13,23,,,,,,,13006,10.3390/su132313006,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132313006,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XV0FT,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000734629800001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Arku, FS",,,,"Arku, Frank S.",,,Local creativity for adapting to climate change among rural farmers in the semi-arid region of Ghana,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Gender; Climate change; Adaptation; Farmers; Ghana; Livelihoods; Rainfall,CHANGE ADAPTATION; LIVELIHOODS; WOMEN,"Purpose - Climate change has emerged as an important theme in the current food security discourses, and although research on local people's adaptation to climate change is increasing, more research is needed to enable sharing of different coping strategies. This research can help policymakers in documenting effective coping strategies that helped to reduce negative impacts of climate change on farmers. The research therefore determined how farmers in rural Ghana use traditional knowledge to adapt to climate changes, and how well the local knowledge worked to enhance livelihoods. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The study took place in three communities in Ghana. Sixty participants consisting 20 from each of the communities were recruited for the study. Data were collected through focus group discussions and semi-structured interview questions. SPSS software was used to analyse the data The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to rank the strategies in enhancing livelihoods. Findings - Men's and women's understanding of what constitute climate change are similar - change in the rainfall amount and distribution. The coping strategies are working as hired labourers, engaging in irrigated farming, practicing of professions learned, rearing of animals, and petty trading. While the importance of the strategies to men's and women's is different, the strategies they adopted appeared to meet their household requirements. Originality/value - The study reveals that local creativities can help in meeting rural farmers' needs during the periods of climate change. Consequently, this research has value for development organisations supporting farmers to effectively use their indigenous knowledge during the periods of climate change.","Presbyterian Univ Coll, Fac Dev Studies, Akropong, Ghana",,"Arku, FS (corresponding author), Presbyterian Univ Coll, Fac Dev Studies, Akropong, Ghana.",fsarku@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,15,15,0,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Within this discourse of extreme' weather, the health sector is promoting climate-controlled indoor environments as a sensible coping strategy. Such responses mask our constant and ongoing adaptations to weather, which are becoming more dynamic and varied in mobile and globalised societies. In this paper, we are interested in reconceptualising adaptation as a series of everyday and remembered experiences with weather, which are situated within and carried by bodily social practices that contribute to keeping warm and cool. We are particularly concerned with what happens to these practices when those who carry them become mobile, through migration to other countries and climates. We consider the proposition that practices involved in staying warm or cool become more adaptable and innovative when they move. We explore these ideas through a study of international students who had recently moved to Melbourne, Australia from a range of countries. Using a practice memory scrapbook' method, we consider how student practices are resurrected, modified and/or transformed on arrival to a new locale, where memories are carried forward and disrupted by local varieties. Our analysis redefines the goal of adaptation as achieving tolerable, interesting, manageable, exciting, challenging and curious conditions; rather than pursuing comfort, familiarity and safety. We conclude that increasing exposure to varied weather conditions may enhance adaptive responses, and call for further research with mobile populations to provide further insight into adaptation to weather.","[Strengers, Yolande; Maller, Cecily] RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Strengers, Y (corresponding author), 124 Latrobe St, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",yolande.strengers@rmit.edu.au,"Maller, Cecily/I-9004-2019","Strengers, Yolande/0000-0002-5664-621X; Maller, Cecily/0000-0001-8322-2124",,,,,64,27,27,1,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0308-518X,1472-3409,,ENVIRON PLANN A,Environ.

To better understand the status of adaptation within state natural resource agencies, we utilized and problematized a rational decision-making framework to characterize adaptation at the level of public land managers in the Upper Midwest. We conducted in-depth interviews with 29 biologists and foresters to provide an understanding of managers' experiences with, and perceptions of, climate change impacts, efforts towards planning for climate change, and a full range of actions implemented to address climate change. While the majority of managers identified climate change impacts affecting their region, they expressed significant uncertainty in interpreting those signals. Just under half of managers indicated planning efforts are underway, although most planning is remote from local management. Actions already implemented include both forward-looking measures and those aimed at coping with current impacts. In addition, cross-scale dynamics emerged as an important theme related to the overall adaptation process. The results hold implications for tracking future progress on climate change adaptation. Common definitions or measures of adaptation (e.g., presence of planning documents) may need to be reassessed for applicability at the level of public land managers.","[Anhalt-Depies, Christine M.; Rissman, Adena R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Knoot, Tricia Gorby; Sharp, Anthony K.] Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, Wildlife & Forestry Res Sect, 2801 Progress Rd, Madison, WI 53716 USA; [Martin, Karl J.] Univ Wisconsin, Cooperat Extens, 432 North Lake St, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Anhalt-Depies, CM (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",anhaltdepies@wisc.edu,,"Rissman, Adena/0000-0001-8566-3708",Upper Midwest and Great Lakes Landscape Conservation Cooperative; Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Bureau of Science Services,Upper Midwest and Great Lakes Landscape Conservation Cooperative; Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Bureau of Science Services,"The authors greatly appreciate project assistance and review by Suzanne Hagell, Mike Larson, Catherine Harris, Tara Bergeson, Alan Crossley, Andy Paulios, Greg Edge, Colleen Matula, Mike Dockry, Maria Janowiak, Jordan Petchenik, William D.

As such, researchers have begun to question what concrete changes in polices are occurring at national levels and what dynamics can explain these changes. While new laws, policies and institutions have been created to deliver adaptation, supported through processes of cross-national policy innovation and learning, another interesting observation being made is that adaptation is steadily emerging into a new separate and distinct policy field in a handful of countries. The purpose of this article is twofold: first, to empirically map where and to what degree adaptation is emerging as a policy field; second, to theoretically and empirically explore the drivers underpinning policy field emergence. Based upon a survey of leading adaptation policy makers in 27 European countries, we show that there are signs of adaptation becoming a policy field in 15 countries. Furthermore, we find that even though institutional change, coupled with increasing public attention and pressure on governments to react to climate change, has helped drive the emergence of adaptation as a policy field, it would appear that it is the activities of elite policy makers and experts that have had the most influence.","[Massey, Eric; Huitema, Dave] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Huitema, Dave] Open Univ Netherlands, Fac Management Sci & Technol, Heerlen, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Open University Netherlands,"Massey, E (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",e.e.massey@vu.nl; d.huitema@vu.nl,"Huitema, Dave/L-1343-2013","Huitema, Dave/0000-0001-8565-3200; Huitema, D./0000-0002-0139-3913",,,,,46,22,23,1,29,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

The major losses of coastal habitats in combination with the commitments of China under the Paris Agreement provide unique opportunity and necessity to develop a strong Chinese BC program. Here, we (1) characterize China's BC habitats, examine their changes since 1950 along with the drivers of changes; (2) consider the expansion of seaweed aquaculture and how this may be managed to become an emerging BC resource in China, along with the engineering solutions required to enhance its potential; and (3) provide the rationale and elements for BC program in China. We find China currently has 1326-2149 km(2) wild and 2-15 km(2) created mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass habitats, while 9236-10059 km(2) (77-87%) has been lost since 1950, mainly due to land reclamation. The current area of farmed seaweed habitat is 1252-1265 km(2), which is close to the area of wild mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass habitats. We conclude that BC strategies have potentials yet to be fully developed in China, particularly through climate change adaptation benefits such as coastal protection and eco-environmental co-benefits of seaweed farming such as habitat creation for fish and other biota, alleviation of eutrophication, hypoxia and acidification, and the generation of direct and value added products with lower environmental impact relative to land-based production. On this basis, we provide a roadmap for BC strategies adjusted to the unique characteristics and capacities of China.","[Wu, Jiaping; Pan, Yiwen; He, Zhiguo; Fan, Wei; Xiao, Xi; Zheng, Yuhan; Gu, Jiali; Zhang, Xiujuan; Zhang, Zhaohui] Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Zhoushan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Haibo] Zhejiang AandF Univ, Sch Environm & Resource Sci, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Haibo] Chinese Acad Sci, Yantai Inst Coastal Zone Res, Yantai, Peoples R China; [Krause-Jensen, Dorte] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Silkeborg, Denmark; [Krause-Jensen, Dorte] Aarhus Univ, Arctic Res Ctr, Aarhus, Denmark; [Chung, Ikkyo] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Oceanog, Busan, South Korea; [Marba, Nuria] Inst Mediterrani Estudis Avancats, Dept Global Change Res, IMEDEA CSIC UIB, Esporles, Illes Balears, Spain; [Serrano, Oscar] Edith Cowan Univ, Ctr Marine Ecosyst Res, Sch Sci, Perth, WA, Australia; [Serrano, Oscar; Duarte, Carlos M.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Perth, WA, Australia; [Rivkin, Richard B.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Ocean Sci, St John, NF, Canada; [Zhao, Peng] Minist Nat Resources, Natl Marine Informat Ctr, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Wanfei] Minist Nat Resources, China Inst Marine Affairs, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Guangcheng] Minist Nat Resources, Lab Marine Biol & Ecol, Inst Oceanog 3, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Duarte, Carlos M.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","Zhejiang University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, CAS; Aarhus University; Aarhus University; Pusan National University; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); ATTITUS Educacao; Universitat de les Illes Balears; Edith Cowan University; University of Western Australia; Memorial University Newfoundland; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; King Abdullah University of Science & Technology","Duarte, CM (corresponding author), King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.;Wu, JP (corresponding author), 1 Zheda Rd, Zhoushan 316021, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",jw67@zju.edu.cn; carlos.duarte@kaust.edu.sa,"Duarte Quesada, Carlos Manuel/ABD-6208-2021; Wu, Jiaping/AAD-8800-2022; xiao, xi/K-1027-2014; Duarte, Carlos M/A-7670-2013; Marba, Nuria/H-8136-2015; He, Zhiguo/M-5164-2015; Krause-Jensen, Dorte/J-5666-2013","xiao, xi/0000-0002-9753-6586; Duarte, Carlos M/0000-0002-1213-1361; Marba, Nuria/0000-0002-8048-6789; He, Zhiguo/0000-0002-0612-9062; Serrano Gras, Oscar/0000-0002-5973-0046; Krause-Jensen, Dorte/0000-0001-9792-256X; Wu, Jiaping/0000-0002-1785-4403",Program of International Science & Technology Cooperation; Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2015DFA01410]; Zhejiang Provincial Department of Science and Technology [2016C04004],"Program of International Science & Technology Cooperation; Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); Zhejiang Provincial Department of Science and Technology","This research was funded by the Program of International Science & Technology Cooperation, the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (grant #2015DFA01410,Bioremediation of polluted coastal water and carbon sequestration) and Zhejiang Provincial Department of Science and Technology (2016C04004).

However, there is a need for more systematic tools to support decision-making processes in the context of climate change impacts and adaptation strategies for the energy and power sectors, For instance, quantitative approaches should be developed and implemented for the assessment of the impacts and hedging strategies associated with the uncertainties inherent to energy and power planning problems. This study addresses the development and implementation of an integrated model-based system analysis, which uses general circulation models, global sensitivity analysis, and stochastic optimization techniques, for the optimal design and planning of the Colombian power system in view of submitted climate pledges and climate change adaptation. It was found that during the 2015 to 2029 time frame, climate change will likely reduce the capacity factor of hydropower generation by 5.5-17.1%. Additionally, it was established that the independent effects of three key uncertain parameters, i.e., capacity factor of hydropower generation, gas prices, and emission reduction target, account for 96% of the variance in the total cost for the required expansion and operation of the power system. Furthermore, when uncertainty is taken into account, the optimal expansion strategy consists of rescheduling of investments in hydropower plants and investing more in carbon management technologies and renewable power plants to compensate for the uncertainty in hydropower generation, climate policy, and gas prices.","[Guerra, Omar J.; Reklaitis, Gintaras V.] Purdue Univ, Sch Chem Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Tejada, Diego A.] Pontifical Comillas Univ, Inst Res Technol IIT, Santa Cruz de Marcenado 26, Madrid 28015, Spain; [Guerra, Omar J.] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO 80401 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Comillas Pontifical University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA,"Reklaitis, GV (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Sch Chem Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",oguerra@purdue.edu; diego.tejada@iit.comillas.edu; reklaiti@purdue.edu,"Reklaitis, Gintaras/AAJ-5106-2020; Tejada-Arango, Diego A./N-5636-2019","Tejada-Arango, Diego A./0000-0002-3278-9283; Guerra, Omar/0000-0003-3740-7149",Colombian Science Council (COLCIENCIAS); Colombia Purdue Institute (CPI),"Colombian Science Council (COLCIENCIAS)(Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias); Colombia Purdue Institute (CPI)","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from the Colombian Science Council (COLCIENCIAS) and the Colombia Purdue Institute (CPI).

These narratives were named naturalist collectivist, religious, religious determinist, activist collectivist and structural thinker.

We develop an approach to estimate the economic potential of crop reallocation using a Bayesian hierarchical model of yields. We apply the model to six crops in the United States, and show that it outperforms traditional empirical models under cross-validation. The fitted model parameters provide evidence of considerable existing climate adaptation across counties. If crop locations are held constant in the future, total agriculture profits for the six crops will drop by 31% for the temperature patterns of 2070 under RCP 8.5. When crop lands are reallocated to avoid yield decreases and take advantage of yield increases, half of these losses are avoided (16% loss), but 57% of counties are allocated crops different from those currently planted. Our results provide a framework for identifying crop adaptation opportunities, but suggest limits to their potential. Switching and relocating crops could be a key pathway for agricultural adaptation to climate change. Here, Rising and Devineni use data-driven Bayesian modelling to estimate the potential for crop switching to mitigate climate impacts on US crop production under a high-emission scenario, showing considerable opportunities but also limitations.","[Rising, James] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Devineni, Naresh] CUNY City Coll, Dept Civil Engn, New York, NY 10031 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY),"Rising, J (corresponding author), London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London WC2A 2AE, England.",j.a.rising@lse.ac.uk,,"Rising, James/0000-0001-8514-4748; Devineni, Naresh/0000-0003-0311-8752",NSF [1360446]; Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics; ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP) [ES/R009708/1]; ESRC [ES/R009708/1] Funding Source: UKRI,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics; ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research was supported by NSF grant 1360446 (Water Sustainability and Climate, Category 3).

A core question is how community members respond to climate change and what factors contribute to more resilient communities. The authors used a contextual approach to analyze data from semi-structured interviews along five dimensions. In Gaustad Muncipality they found that individuals' motivation to adapt to climate change depended largely on subjective values such as identity, place attachment, cultural values, and social networks among individuals, which means it is crucial that strategic plans for adaptation to climate change at different policy levels are experienced as relevant by community members. While the studied community has experienced heavy floods in river systems and streams, little evidence of adaptation was observed. Instead, they appeared to adopt coping strategies. Landowners may have limited incentives to adapt to climate change due to contraproductive policy measures such as economic compensation for direct losses without requiring improved practices. Effective adaptation to climate change on the local level is likely to require making compensation mechanisms contingent upon landowners showing willingness to change from coping to adaptive practices, as well as a contextualized approach integrating local and scientific forms of knowledge.","[Gundersen, Vegard; Kaltenborn, Bjorn Petter] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, NO-2624 Fakkelgarden, Lillehammer, Norway; [Williams, Daniel R.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA",Norwegian Institute Nature Research; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Gundersen, V (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Nat Res, NO-2624 Fakkelgarden, Lillehammer, Norway.",vegard.gundersen@nina.no,,,"US Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","US Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","The research was funded by a grant from the US Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA.

This paper uses a noncooperative game theory model to investigate the relationship between adaptation technology and the formation of emissions-reducing international environmental agreements (IEAs) on climate change, with countries that are heterogeneous with respect to the benefits and costs of both mitigation and adaptation. While differences in climate vulnerability are a deterrent for cooperation, increasing the effectiveness of adaptation in highly vulnerable countries can foster an IEA. Both traditional free riding on climate change mitigation efforts, and free riding on adaptation technology among members of an IEA can be reduced by transfers of adaptation technology within the IEA. A numerical example with parameters estimated from climate change data is used to simulate stable coalitions and demonstrate how the transfer of adaptation technology reduces free riding on an IEA.","[Li, Hongxiu; Rus, Horatiu A.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Li, HX (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",h254li@uwaterloo.ca; hrus@uwaterloo.ca,,,,,,,39,6,6,4,27,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

The adaptation themes that emerged captured essence of measures and experience drawn from varied country submissions and contexts instituted to make the livestock sector climate compatible in as far as adaptation is concerned. Design/methodology/approach - Literature survey approach was used on the impacts of climate change on livestock and a review of the submitted adaptation measures. The study used grounded theory approach to derive meaning from the retrieved information. The grounded theory was derived inductively through systematic collection and analysis of data pertaining to the submitted National Communications reports. The retrieved themes were then examined and interpreted to give meaning and draw conclusions through coding, conceptualizing, categorizing and theorizing. Findings - Results identify eight adaptation themes: carrying capacity and policies; integrated pasture management; capacity building, extension, training, awareness and information sharing; livestock breeding, diversification and intensification; disease, vectors and parasites management; technology, innovation, research and development; alternative livelihood; and water supply. The findings show that African Governments have been implementing effective adaptation measures for food security through building a climate resilient livestock production system. Originality/value - This study is one of the first to lead to recommendations that decision- and policymakers, private sectors, relevant stakeholders and government officials and scientists should play a key role in ensuring that adaptation measures reach farmers, herders at grassroots level. In addition, governments should create an enabling environment (policies) in climate change adaptation to improve food security. These recommendations might be helpful in many communities where adaptation to climate change is a pressing issue.","[Muchuru, Shepherd; Nhamo, Godwell] Univ South Africa, Inst Corp Citizenship, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Muchuru, S (corresponding author), Univ South Africa, Inst Corp Citizenship, Pretoria, South Africa.",shephido@yahoo.com,"Nhamo, Godwell/N-5165-2015","Nhamo, Godwell/0000-0001-5465-2168",Exxaro Chair in Business and Climate Change under UNISA's Institute for Corporate Citizenship,Exxaro Chair in Business and Climate Change under UNISA's Institute for Corporate Citizenship,This research is supported by the Exxaro Chair in Business and Climate Change under UNISA's Institute for Corporate Citizenship.,,93,7,7,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Thus, there is a strong push to integrate the two fields to enhance aid effectiveness and reduce confusion for communities. Examples of community based disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) projects are presented to highlight some of the ways these issues are tackled in the Pacific. Various approaches are employed but all aim to reduce the vulnerability and enhance the resilience of local communities to the impacts of climate change and disasters. By focusing on three case studies, elements of best practice are drawn out to illustrate how DRR and CCA can be integrated for enhanced aid effectiveness, and also look at ways in which these two often overlapping fields can be better coordinated in ongoing and future projects. Projects that address vulnerability holistically, and target the overall needs and capacity of the community are found to be effective in enhancing the resilience of communities. By strategically developing a multi-stakeholder and multi-sector approach, community projects are likely to encapsulate a range of experience and skills that will benefit the community Furthermore, by incorporating local knowledge, communities are far more likely to be engaged and actively participate in the project. From selected case studies, commonly occurring best practice methods to integrate DRR and CCA are identified and discussed and recommendations on how to overcome the common challenges also presented.","[Gero, A.] Univ New S Wales, Australian Tsunami Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; Univ New S Wales, Nat Hazards Res Lab, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Gero, A (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Australian Tsunami Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",anna.f.gero@gmail.com,"Ahluwalia, Tarun/A-2762-2012","Dominey-Howes, Dale/0000-0003-2677-2837; Gero, Anna/0000-0001-7047-4250",AusAID Australian Development Research Award [0800028],AusAID Australian Development Research Award,"This work was funded by an AusAID Australian Development Research Award (0800028) to Meheux and Dominey-Howes.

In this research, 6 climate change adaptation indicators were identified for Can Tho City in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam: (1) Rice production from wastewater during winter-spring crop; (2) % of irrigation water demand satisfied by treated wastewater; (3) % of nutrient demand satisfied by treated wastewater; (4) % remaining flow downstream of Can Tho in the Hau River; (5) environmental benefits; and (6) total investment cost for wastewater treatment. These indices were selected to assess various options/strategies for wastewater management and reuse in Can Tho City as a means to improve the City's resilience to climate change. From an environmental perspective, this study shows the benefits for Can Tho City to set up a strategy to treat and reuse wastewater from catfish farming as the priority among four assessed scenarios with different climate change impact factors. It is concluded that adaptation can be assessed by the indicators because they can define whether adaptation policies and measures are implemented and whether vulnerability is reduced through effective actions.","[Long Thi Trinh; Van Der Steen, Peter; Lens, Piet N.

Restoration and rehabilitation of all abandoned tanks is one such contribution in the irrigation sector. The country has around 13,600 working village tanks of ancient origin. These restored tanks provide irrigation and other water needs at different degrees while a large number of tanks remain abandoned. However, regional storage behaviour of the restored tanks is not adequately understood due to the non-existence of a methodology for storage data collection and assessment. The study presents a statistical approach to assess regional storage behaviour of the tanks with data collected using five storage states method. The storage data of 573 working village tanks in southern Sri Lanka covering three years were analyzed, and revealed a high temporal variation of storage behaviour and low resilience to recover from either dryness or failure for providing irrigation water issues. However, higher time-reliability of water-existence below sluice sill level indicates their potential for providing social and environmental needs. Such assessments facilitate identifying real-time management measures and reviewing policy on restoration of similar reservoirs as an adaptation option for climate change in any region.","[Perera, K.

Literature stresses the necessity to link disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) to make more efficient use of scarce resources and avoid overlapping efforts. However, integrating interventions for DRR and CCA remains a challenge because these two concepts originated from separate research-experts and are articulated by different sets of practitioners. Little study has yet investigated the challenges confronting integration and how best to overcome them in different contexts. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted indepth interviews with 38 key stakeholders to explore the practices surrounding the integration of DRR and CCA in Bangladesh. As both approaches have similar aims to reduce vulnerabilities and increase resilience, the main arguments for linking DRR and CCA found were: to decrease overlapping of efforts and to improve the efficient use of scarce resources. Key challenges to the effective integration of DRR and CCA are found to be: inappropriate funding mechanisms, a lack of coordination and collaboration, a lack of implementation and mainstreaming, scale mismatches, poor governance, the socio-political-cultural structure, competing actors and institutions, lack of information, communication, knowledge sharing, and community involvement, and policy gaps. These challenges are underpinned by political economy, the nexus of influencing actors relevant to DRR and CCA. This study thus recommends that an in-depth political economy analysis of these challenges should be undertaken to identify reoriented institutional arrangements, and efficient governance frameworks to assist effective integration of DRR and CCA.","[Islam, Shafiqul] Griffith Univ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Chu, Cordia] Griffith Univ, Ctr Environm & Hlth, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Smart, James C.

This paper reviews 41 NAPAs submitted by Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to assess the NAPA process in terms of NAPAs integration with countries' national development strategies. The review outlines the actors involved in developing NAPAs and identifies the range of interventions included in countries' priority adaptation actions. The paper uses the example of population as an issue related to both climate change and national development to assess how it is addressed as part of LDCs' adaptation and national development agendas. The analysis shows that although countries recognize population pressure as an issue related to the ability to cope with climate change and as a factor hindering progress in meeting development goals, it is not well incorporated into either adaptation planning or in national development strategies. Among the 41 NAPAs, 37 link high and rapid population growth to climate change. Moreover, six NAPAs clearly state that slowing population growth or investments in reproductive health/family planning (RH/FP) should be considered among the country's priority adaptation actions. Furthermore, two NAPAs actually propose a project with components of RH/FP among their priority adaptation interventions, although none of them has yet been funded. The paper points to structural issues that hamper better alignment between climate change adaptation and national development planning and offers recommendations for longer-term adaptation strategies that better meet the development needs of countries.","[Hardee, Karen; Mutunga, Clive] Populat Act Int, Washington, DC USA",,"Mutunga, C (corresponding author), 1300 19th St NW,2nd Floor, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",cmutunga@popact.org,,,,,,,37,47,49,1,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

Research attention has focused on climatic stressors, such as rainfall variability, with few empirical studies exploring non-climatic stressors and how these interact with climatic stressors at multiple scales to affect food security and livelihoods. This focus on climatic factors restricts understanding of the combinations of stressors that exacerbate the vulnerability of farming households and hampers the development of holistic climate change adaptation policies. This study addresses this particular research gap by adopting a multi-scale approach to understand how climatic and non-climatic stressors vary, and interact, across three spatial scales (household, community and district levels) to influence livelihood vulnerability of smallholder farming households in the Savannah zone of northern Ghana. This study across three case study villages utilises a series of participatory tools including semi-structured interviews, key informant interviews and focus group discussions. The incidence, importance, severity and overall risk indices for stressors are calculated at the household, community, and district levels. Results show that climatic and non-climatic stressors were perceived differently; yet, there were a number of common stressors including lack of money, high cost of farm inputs, erratic rainfall, cattle destruction of crops, limited access to markets and lack of agricultural equipment that crossed all scales. Results indicate that the gender of respondents influenced the perception and severity assessment of stressors on rural livelihoods at the community level. Findings suggest a mismatch between local and district level priorities that have implications for policy and development of agricultural and related livelihoods in rural communities. Ghana's climate change adaptation policies need to take a more holistic approach that integrates both climatic and non-climatic factors to ensure policy coherence between national climate adaptation plans and District development plans.","[Antwi-Agyei, Philip] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Sci, Coll Sci, Kumasi, Ghana; [Quinn, Claire Helen; Dougill, Andrew John] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Adiku, Samuel Godfried Kwasi] Univ Ghana, Sch Agr, Dept Soil Sci, Legon, Ghana; [Codjoe, Samuel Nii Ardey; Dovie, Delali Benjamin Komla] Univ Ghana, Reg Inst Populat Studies, Legon, Ghana; [Lamboll, Richard] Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Cent Ave, Chatham ME4 4TB, Kent, England; [Dovie, Delali Benjamin Komla] Univ Ghana, Dept Geog & Resource Dev, Legon, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Leeds; University of Ghana; University of Ghana; University of Greenwich; University of Ghana,"Antwi-Agyei, P (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Sci, Coll Sci, Kumasi, Ghana.",philiantwi@yahoo.com,"Antwi-Agyei, Philip/AAI-7392-2020; Quinn, Claire/AAU-8184-2020","Antwi-Agyei, Philip/0000-0002-8599-474X; Dovie, Delali Benjamin K/0000-0002-2165-1721; Quinn, Claire/0000-0002-2085-0446",Department for International Development (DfID) under the Climate Impact Research Capacity and Leadership Enhancement (CIRCLE) programme; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Department for International Development (DfID) under the Climate Impact Research Capacity and Leadership Enhancement (CIRCLE) programme; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research was supported by funding from the Department for International Development (DfID) under the Climate Impact Research Capacity and Leadership Enhancement (CIRCLE) programme.

Australia's coastal cities and towns, with over 85 per cent of the nation's population, are at the frontline of physical risks associated with sea level rise and changed weather patterns; exacerbated by ongoing concentration of public and private assets in potentially vulnerable locations. This is particularly so for coastal councils beyond the major capital cities, where settlement patterns and lifestyle oriented economies based on tourism and leisure focus on the coastal strip, and local government resources are highly constrained. To assess progress in climate change adaptation planning, this study involved local government professionals, experts and elected officials through a survey and focus groups (n = 49) held between February and July 2011. The audit indicates some areas are well underway towards holistic adaptation strategies but, others have neither engaged, nor anticipate, adaptation planning activities; of the strategies that have commenced, few are yet completed; and, despite ongoing development pressure, few councils have yet changed their planning controls for climate risk. Of those areas that have commenced adaptation planning, most strategies and commitments will require additional resourcing and external expertise to implement; while others face community skepticism and pushback which may undermine future progress. The results reveal a ladder of adaptation action, whereby communities tend to have to accomplish early steps before they move on to more complex, expensive, or political policies.

The crisis is causing starvation and leading to a lack of access to clean water and sanitation for over 12 million people. Not only are the direct drought effects endured now by the population, but they have weakened response capacity and created diminished prospects of ever achieving future water and food security. Over the coming decades, temperatures in this region will continue to rise and rainfall patterns will change. This will create major problems for food production and availability. Thus, building resilience in communities is indispensable as we adapt our farming systems to the challenges of climate change. This will require practical solutions that can build on processes involving adaptation to climate change. The lessons learned from the UN-led project in Uganda, demonstrate the value of small scale innovative interventions, carried out using democratic approaches to help support adaptation to climate change whilst progressing to achieve food security and chart a new Path to eliminate hunger. These lessons should be our guiding vision as we address the current droughts plaguing the Horn of East Africa and elsewhere.","[Munang, Richard] UNDP, Climate Change Adaptat & Dev Initiat CC DARE, Nairobi, Kenya; UNEP, Nairobi, Kenya",,"Munang, R (corresponding author), UNDP, Climate Change Adaptat & Dev Initiat CC DARE, POB 30552-00100, Nairobi, Kenya.",Richard.Munang@unep.org; Johnson.Nkem@undp.org,,,Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark,Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark,The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark provided the funds for this project.

Much of the literature on gender dimensions of climate change adaptation has focused on assessing differences in coping and adaptation practices of smallholder farmers. Mostly overlooked is whether gender influences influenced perception of effectiveness of adaptation practices and preferences for institutional support for future adaptation. Using key informant interviews, household surveys, and focus group discussions, we address these gaps by exploring coping and adaptation measures adopted by heads of farm households to counter climate change impacts on their livelihood activities and household well-being in the Guinea Savanna agroecological zone in Ghana. Additionally, we assessed the preferred institutional adaptation support of heads of farm households in adapting to future projected impacts. We find that female heads of farm households relied mainly on borrowed money from village savings and loans group as a coping measure; male heads of farm households depended primarily on sales of livestock. Varying planting and harvesting dates, crop diversification, and use of improved crop varieties were the major adaptation strategies adopted by farmers. We argue that provision of dams and/or dugouts, postharvest processing facilities, adaptation capacity-building resources, and improved access to markets and credit could enhance the adaptive capacity of male and female heads of farm households to mitigate projected climate change impacts on their livelihood activities and household well-being.","[Assan, Elsie; Suvedi, Murari; Olabisi, Laura Schmitt] Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, Room 135,480 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Allen, Andrea] Michigan State Univ, Coll Social Sci, Ctr Adv Study Int Dev, 427 N Shaw Lane,Room 202, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Assan, E (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, Room 135,480 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",assanels@msu.edu; suvedi@msu.edu; schmi420@msu.edu; allenan9@msu.edu,"Suvedi, Murari/AAD-2811-2020",,"Department of Community Sustainability, Michigan State University, USA","Department of Community Sustainability, Michigan State University, USA","We appreciate financial support from the Department of Community Sustainability, Michigan State University, USA, in the conduct of this research.

These vary from increased exposures to floods, to discomfort due to urban heat, depending on their geographical locations and settings. However, even though some cities have a greater ability to cope with climate change challenges, many struggle to do so, particularly in cities in developing countries. In addition, there is a shortage of international studies which examine the links between climate change adaptation and cities, and which at the same time draw some successful examples of good practice, which may assist future efforts. This paper is an attempt to address this information need. The aim of this paper is to analyse the extent to which cities in a sample of developing countries are attempting to pursue climate change adaptation and the problems which hinder this process. Its goal is to showcase examples of initiatives and good practice in transformative adaptation, which may be replicable elsewhere. To this purpose, the paper describes some trends related to climate change in a set of cities in developing countries across different continents, including one of the smallest capital cities (Georgetown, Guyana) and Shanghai, one the world's most populous cities. In particular, it analyses their degree of vulnerability, how they manage to cope with climate change impacts, and the policies being implemented to aid adaptation. It also suggests the use of transformative approaches which may be adopted, in order to assist them in their efforts towards investments in low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure, thereby maximizing investments in urban areas and trying to address their related poverty issues. This paper addresses a gap in the international literature on the problems many cities in developing countries face, in trying to adapt to a changing climate. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Different climate change phenomena in recent years have affected resilience of smallholder farmers in Vietnam and ecosystems where they live. The importance of ecosystem services in climate change adaptation was investigated in surveys, focus group discussions, meetings and interviews with key district and commune staff, male and female farmers of Son Tho commune in rural North Central Region of Vietnam. In conjunction with surveys an Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) pilot was conducted in 2016 and 2017 with a group of 26 smallholder households. All survey respondents acknowledged that they depend on ecosystems and services for their livelihoods. Extreme weather events are predicted to increase with climate change. Smallholder farmers and ecosystems were most vulnerable to the effects of droughts and heat waves that limited supplies of clean water and impacted crop harvests, and by storms, whirlwinds and cold spells. The EbA pilot identified that all ecological patches provided direct and indirect benefits through multiple goods and services generated for provision, regulation, supporting and cultural services. The pilot demonstrated that ecosystem services supported smallholder farmers to adapt to extreme events and climate change, in particular, by mitigating the effects of droughts. Management of ecosystem services can provide joint benefits for both climate change mitigation and adaptation, particularly where the spatial distributions of carbon, hydrological services or biodiversity are positively correlated.","[Lien Tran] Deutsch Gesell Int Zusammenarbeit GIZ GmbH, 49 Hai Ba Trung, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Brown, Kathryn] Southern Cross Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia",Southern Cross University,"Tran, L (corresponding author), Deutsch Gesell Int Zusammenarbeit GIZ GmbH, 49 Hai Ba Trung, Hanoi, Vietnam.",tranthikimlien@gmail.com,"Brown, Kathryn/AAE-9933-2021; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Brown, Kathryn/0000-0002-9093-8742",,,,,36,10,10,2,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4366,1572-9680,,AGROFOREST SYST,Agrofor.

However, current understanding of institutions in adaptation situations is fragmented across the scientific community, evidence diverges, and cumulative learning beyond single studies is limited. This study adopts a diagnostic approach to elaborate a nuanced understanding of institutional barriers and opportunities in climate adaptation by means of a model-centred meta-analysis of 52 case studies of public climate adaptation in Europe. The first result is a novel taxonomy of institutional attributes in adaptation situations. It conceptually organises and decomposes the many details of institutions that empirical research has shown to shape climate adaptation. In the second step, the paper identifies archetypical patterns of institutional traps and trade-offs which hamper adaptation. Thirdly, corresponding opportunities are identified that enable actors to alleviate, prevent or overcome specific institutional traps or trade-offs. These results cast doubt on the validity of general institutional design principles for successful adaptation. In contrast to generic principles, the identified opportunities provide leverage to match institutions to specific governance problems that are encountered in specific contexts. Taken together, the results may contribute to more coherence and integration of adaptation research that we need if we are to foster learning about the role of institutions in adaptation situations in a cumulative fashion.","[Oberlack, Christoph] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Dept Econ, Pl Alten Synagoge, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany; [Oberlack, Christoph] Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, Hallerstr 10, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",University of Freiburg; University of Bern,"Oberlack, C (corresponding author), Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Dept Econ, Pl Alten Synagoge, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.;Oberlack, C (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, Hallerstr 10, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",christoph.oberlack@cde.unibe.ch,,"Oberlack, Christoph/0000-0003-2813-7327",,,,,113,56,57,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

In this paper, we present a systematic and in-depth review of existing literature to examine the possibilities of indigenous floating agriculture as a technique for climate change adaptation and sustainable community development in Bangladesh. Our review indicates that the indigenous floating agriculture holds enough potential to help farming communities in the flood prone regions of Bangladesh to sustain lives and livelihoods during floods and long-term waterlogged conditions. This technique has a unique quality of providing a wide range of agricultural, environmental, economic, social and cultural benefits, which ultimately render it as an environmentally sound, economically feasible, and socially viable practice. Case studies on a number of promotional and experimental floating agriculture projects in different regions of Bangladesh revealed that the floating agriculture greatly supported farming communities to adapt to adverse waterlogged conditions by allowing vegetable production for daily consumption, income generation, community mobilization, and by increasing land-holding capacity. Along with providing food and nutrition security, this technique also strengthened the community capacity to grow and sustain agricultural practices in the subsequent floods and waterlogging conditions. Although this technique has a number of sustain ability challenges as highlighted in this study, many of these are possible to overcome through proper planning and long-term management initiatives. We recommend policy implications and future research needs that could be effectively utilized to render this technique as a suitable tool for climate change adaptation and sustainable community development in Bangladesh.

Drawing on Donna Haraway's idea of situated knowledges, this paper develops an approach to mixing disciplines by engaging in epistemological pluralism, or approaching a research problem through more than one way of conceptualising it. The example of climate change adaptation planning in Nepal is used to show how a hybrid methodology research design requires thinking through what can be known and also what cannot be known by using a particular method. The main argument is that it is not possible to prove methodologically which conceptualisation or analytical entry point is better than another. Rather, new insights are gained both by triangulating data from different methods, and by probing the ways that they present contradictory results. An interdisciplinary research design is therefore used as a kind of kaleidoscope wherein plural epistemologies help to reveal new, albeit partial and situated, patterns.","[Nightingale, Andrea J.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Nightingale, Andrea J.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragr, N-1432 As, Norway",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Nightingale, AJ (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.;Nightingale, AJ (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragr, N-1432 As, Norway.",andrea.nightingale@slu.se,,"Nightingale, Andrea Joslyn/0000-0001-5343-9576","British Academy International Partnership and Mobility Award, 'Political Violence and Climate Change'","British Academy International Partnership and Mobility Award, 'Political Violence and Climate Change'","The original draft of this paper was composed in a small 'hutte' with pen and paper, sitting by a wood-burning stove in Lauvlia, Norway.

Adaptation strategy development is particularly complex in estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems because of their diverse environmental values, extensive human utilisation and the complex socioecological systems they support. Although many generic adaptation frameworks are available they cannot provide specific guidance for locally relevant strategy development. In contrast, situation-specific tools work well for their intended purpose but are usually unsuitable for a different situation. The gap between generic frameworks and situation-specific tools is addressed in this study by developing a set of general principles to provide guidance for the efficient and robust development of adaptation strategies. The nine principles comprise a conceptualisation of the various factors that are likely to have an effect on the success or otherwise of an adaptation strategy and they apply in any situation.

A particular challenge is that the microbial communities that drive many of these processes are capable of adapting to environmental change in ways that alter ecosystem functioning. Despite evidence that microbes can adapt to temperature, precipitation regimes, and redox fluctuations, microbial communities are typically not optimally adapted to their local environment. For example, temperature optima for growth and enzyme activity are often greater than in situ temperatures in their environment. Here we discuss fundamental constraints on microbial adaptation and suggest specific environments where microbial adaptation to climate change (or lack thereof) is most likely to alter ecosystem functioning. Our framework is based on two principal assumptions. First, there are fundamental ecological trade-offs in microbial community traits that occur across environmental gradients (in time and space). These trade-offs result in shifting of microbial function (e.g. ability to take up resources at low temperature) in response to adaptation of another trait (e.g. limiting maintenance respiration at high temperature). Second, the mechanism and level of microbial community adaptation to changing environmental parameters is a function of the potential rate of change in community composition relative to the rate of environmental change. Together, this framework provides a basis for developing testable predictions about how the rate and degree of microbial adaptation to climate change will alter biogeochemical processes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems across the planet.","[Wallenstein, Matthew D.; Hall, Edward K.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Wallenstein, Matthew D.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University; Colorado State University,"Wallenstein, MD (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",matthew.wallenstein@colostate.edu,"Wallenstein, Matthew/C-6441-2008; Wallenstein, Matthew D/S-3512-2016; Hall, Ed/C-6013-2014","Wallenstein, Matthew/0000-0002-6219-1442; Wallenstein, Matthew D/0000-0002-6219-1442; ","National Science Foundation Division of Environmental Biology [1020540, 0842315]; Office of Polar Programs [0902030, 0733074]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [0842315, 1020540] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation Division of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Office of Polar Programs(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),This research was supported by grants to MDW from the National Science Foundation Division of Environmental Biology (#1020540 and 0842315) and Office of Polar Programs (#0902030 and 0733074).,,85,223,230,7,234,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0168-2563,1573-515X,,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,Biogeochemistry,JUL,2012,109,1-3,,,,,35,47,,10.1007/s10533-011-9641-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-011-9641-8,,,13,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,933QT,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000303377800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Boateng, I",,,,"Boateng, Isaac",,,GIS assessment of coastal vulnerability to climate change and coastal adaption planning in Vietnam,JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Coastal vulnerability; Adaptation planning; Climate change and coastal zone of Vietnam,SEA-LEVEL RISE; FLOOD,"Vietnam's coastal zone provides a diverse range of natural resources and favourable conditions for social and economic development. However, its coastal ecosystems are highly vulnerable, due to several natural coastal hazards, over-exploitation and other human activities. In spite of diverse interventions, Vietnam's coastal zone continues to experience significant damage from floods, erosion and typhoons. These hazards are being intensified by climate change and associated rising sea levels. This paper assesses the potential vulnerability of Vietnam's coast to climate change and discusses possible adaptation policies and plan to reduce the impacts. GIS analysis was used for the assessment of coastal vulnerability. Related literature was reviewed to develop detailed understanding of coastal adaptation to climate change. Adaptation policies and plans were appraised to identify potential coastal adaptation policies and plans that could be adapted by Vietnam. It was identified that vulnerability of the coastal zone of Vietnam could not be attributed only to climatic factors, but also to the physical condition of the coastline. Much of Vietnam's coastline, particularly, areas around the Red River delta and the Mekong River have elevations below 1 m. These coastlines are largely developed and serve as economic centres of the country, which makes the coast more vulnerable to climate change and the rising sea level. The paper concluded that a non-structural approach (coastal buffer zones, building houses on stilts, storm warning systems, growing of flood-resistant crops and elevated storm shelters with medicine and food storage) could be used by Vietnam to adapt her low-lying coastline around the two deltas to climate change as this strategy enables vulnerable areas to be occupied for longer before eventual retreat. However, for these policies to be successful, it should be planned, implemented well in advance, monitored and evaluated over time.","Univ Portsmouth, Sch Civil Engn & Surveying, Portsmouth PO1 3AH, Hants, England",University of Portsmouth,"Boateng, I (corresponding author), Univ Portsmouth, Sch Civil Engn & Surveying, Portland Bldg,Portland St, Portsmouth PO1 3AH, Hants, England.",Isaac.boateng@port.ac.uk,"Boateng, Isaac/AFL-3730-2022","Boateng, Isaac/0000-0002-2203-4688","School of Civil Engineering and Surveying, University of Portsmouth","School of Civil Engineering and Surveying, University of Portsmouth","The author would like to acknowledge the School of Civil Engineering and Surveying, University of Portsmouth for sponsoring the travel to Vietnam.",,29,37,38,2,155,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1400-0350,1874-7841,,J COAST CONSERV,J.

(2) Climate change is rarely the sole or primary motivator for adaptation action. (3) Extreme events are important adaptation stimuli across regions. (4) Proactive adaptation is the most commonly reported adaptive response, particularly in developed nations.

This study examines the factors affecting non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners' preferences for such forest management practices. A systematic literature review serves as a reference for the empirical analysis of a survey data on the Finnish NIPF owners' stated willingness to adopt thirteen distinct forest management practices. Binary logit models reveal socio-demographic factors, site-specific characteristics, previous forest management, and motivations for forest ownership that are associated with the stated adoption of management practices. Especially, environmental and financial motivations play an important role in decisions concerning forest management practices. Statistically significant factors vary depending on the forest management practice, reflecting the NIPF owner heterogeneity. Younger and highly educated forest owners are more supportive for various management practices that promote biodiversity, while older forest owners are reluctant towards deadwood retention. The results underline the importance of accounting for heterogeneous preferences regarding forest management practices when designing and implementing policies and advisory services aiming at enhancing carbon sequestration, climate change adaptation, or biodiversity in boreal commercial forests.","[Husa, Miikka; Kosenius, Anna-Kaisa] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, POB 27, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Husa, Miikka] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Latokartanonkaari 9, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Kosenius, AK (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, POB 27, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",anna-kaisa.kosenius@helsinki.fi,"Kosenius, Anna-Kaisa/F-9417-2017","Kosenius, Anna-Kaisa/0000-0002-1528-8145",Strategic Research Funding/Academy of Finland [SRC 2017/312637/IBC-Carbon],Strategic Research Funding/Academy of Finland,This work was supported by the Strategic Research Funding/Academy of Finland [Grant Number SRC 2017/312637/IBC-Carbon].,,59,3,3,6,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",0282-7581,1651-1891,,SCAND J FOREST RES,Scand.

NAP monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems can play an important role in tracking implementation but have rarely been studied. Based on a systematic review including outreach to country representatives and international organizations, a comprehensive inventory of NAP M&E systems is compiled documenting government practices from over 60 countries. In contrast to previous studies, this stocktake does not rely on stated intentions of M&E but requires evidence such as monitoring and evaluation reports. The extent of NAP M&E involvement globally and countries' respective status are determined and compared to a baseline from the 2017 Adaptation Gap Report of the United Nations Environment Programme. Results show a 40% increase in the number of countries that are developing or using NAP M&E systems and almost a doubling of published NAP evaluations. However, over 60% of countries that adopted a NAP do not systematically assess its implementation, leaving a critical gap in understanding the impacts of NAPs. These findings support calls for greater attention to the quality of adaptation planning and for assessing its implementation and effectiveness.","[Leiter, Timo] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Leiter, T (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",T.L.Leiter@lse.ac.uk,"Leiter, Timo/Y-8069-2019","Leiter, Timo/0000-0003-4982-8063","UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/P000622/1, 2098296]; ESRC [2098296, ES/P000622/1] Funding Source: UKRI",UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Funding for this research was provided by the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under grant number ES/P000622/1, project reference 2098296.",,46,8,8,0,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

However, limited attention has been given to integration of bottom-up and top-down methods for assessment of adaptation options. The integrated approach used in this study uses hydrological modelling to assess the effect of stakeholder prioritized adaptation options for the Kangsabati river catchment in India. A series of 14 multi-level stakeholder consultations are used to ascertain locally relevant no-regret adaptation options using Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) and scenario analysis methods. A validated Water Evaluation And Planning (WEAP) model is then used to project the effect of three options; option 1 check dams (CD), option 2 increasing forest cover (IFC) and option 3 combined CD and IFC, on future (2021-2050) streamflow. High resolution (similar to 25 km) climatic projections from four Regional Climate Models (RCMs) and their ensemble based on the SRES A1B scenario for the mid-21st century period are used to force the WEAP model. Results indicate that although all three adaptation options reduce streamflow, in comparison with scenario without adaptation, their magnitude, temporal pattern and effect on high and low streamflows are different. Options 2 and 3 reduce streamflow percentage by an order of magnitude greater than option 1. These characteristics affect their ability to address key adaptation requirements and therefore, we find that IFC emerges as a hydrologically suitable adaptation option for the study area. Based on study results we also conclude that such an integrated approach is advantageous and is a valuable tool for locally relevant climate change adaptation policymaking. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This also means too little attention to the importance of locally driven adaptation, both to reduce risks and to be better prepared to cope with consequences. This paper reviews the many initiatives underway in India that respond to climate change, and discusses what else is needed to mainstream effective adaptation, as well as identifying what currently constrains this. It also discusses how adaptation has to be mainstreamed within urban development and urban governance. Most municipal authorities in India are already grappling with large deficits in infrastructure and services and do not see climate change adaptation as a priority or as their responsibility.

Recent studies show that these calls are taken up only reluctantly in local adaptation compared to sectoral and technical solutions. The aim of this study is to examine to which extent adaptation as an embedded process within the local context allows for stakeholder participation, cooperation and the robustness and flexibility of adaptation measures. It applies an analytical approach, combining an action framework of adaptation and document-based discourse analysis, to assess both the procedural and the substantive viewpoint of an adaptation case in Finland. This twofold approach provides insight into how the adaptation process and content influence and condition each other. The analysis highlights how new approaches to adaptation have to compete with prevailing discourses and institutionalised practices, as public authorities take the dominant role in adaptation, striving for certain and safe solutions. This process has few participatory elements and leaves little leeway to address uncertainty.","[Klein, Johannes] Aalto Univ, Land Use Planning & Urban Studies Grp, Dept Real Estate Planning & Geoinformat, Rakentajanaukio 2 C, Espoo 02150, Finland",Aalto University,"Klein, J (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Land Use Planning & Urban Studies Grp, Dept Real Estate Planning & Geoinformat, Rakentajanaukio 2 C, Espoo 02150, Finland.",johannes.klein@aalto.fi,,"Klein, Johannes/0000-0003-0721-4063",,,,,64,4,5,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,,2016,21,2,,,,,254,271,,10.1080/13549839.2014.945405,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2014.945405,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,DP0GM,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000378167300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Observational data were collected from in-depth interviews with 352 rice farm households in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. The findings indicate that 71% of local farmers adapted their rice farming to climate change related to salinity intrusion and drought, while 29% of farmers did not. Additionally, only twenty-two rice farmers were typically chosen as participants in the climate smart agriculture pilot program by local government and institutions. The choices for adaptation response and climate smart agriculture participation are significantly influenced by agricultural extension services, belief in climate change, the area of farming land, as well as geographical locations (e.g., province and access to water sources). The results also reveal that climate change adaptation response, including climate smart agriculture participation, played a crucial role in improving technical efficiency of rice production by 13%-14% compared to no adaptation response. Regarding the individual effect of climate smart agriculture participation, participants could achieve higher technical efficiency by 5%-8% compared to non-participants.","[Thanh Tam Ho] Ritsumeikan Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-1-1 Noji Higashi, Kusatsu, Shiga 5258577, Japan; [Shimada, Koji] Ritsumeikan Univ, Fac Econ, 1-1-1 Noji Higashi, Kusatsu, Shiga 5258577, Japan",Ritsumeikan University; Ritsumeikan University,"Ho, TT (corresponding author), Ritsumeikan Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-1-1 Noji Higashi, Kusatsu, Shiga 5258577, Japan.",gr0335xp@ed.ritsumei.ac.jp; shimada@ec.ritsumei.ac.jp,"Shimada, Koji/AAM-8654-2020","shimada, Koji/0000-0002-8295-331X","Social System Research Institute Mission, Ritsumeikan University","Social System Research Institute Mission, Ritsumeikan University","This research was funded by Social System Research Institute Mission, Ritsumeikan University in the year of 2018.",,44,18,18,7,32,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,MAY,2019,9,5,,,,,,,99,10.3390/agriculture9050099,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture9050099,,,20,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,IE8VG,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000472651000014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our analyses show that municipalities have more often invested in measures related to extreme precipitation and flooding than in measures for securing buildings and infrastructure against climate change. One key factor explaining their efforts is whether they have experienced extreme events. Hence adaptation efforts are mainly reactive. With a changing climate comes a greater demand for proactive adaptation processes, as well as knowledge of how adaptation policies and measures could be implemented successfully.

We derived a basic framework of biophilic urbanism by analyzing and reviewing the concepts and strategies of biophilic urbanism presented in previous studies. Based on this review, an advanced biophilic urbanism framework is suggested to examine the application of biophilic elements in cities. The framework consists of (1) the spatial range divided into region and city, neighborhood and street, and building and (2) the degree of biophilic method, which includes the natural, technical, and functional method. In addition, the representative biophilic elements for climate change adaptation are categorized using the framework. This framework provides an opportunity to identify and supplement the lack of biophilic elements in a city by enabling a systematic review of the biophilic elements according to the various spatial ranges and biophilic methods. Therefore, biophilic elements can be effectively applied within a city, and it is possible to create an environment where humans can experience various benefits as well as obtain psychological stability from nature.","[Lee, Sunghee; Kim, Youngchul] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, KAIST Smart City Res Ctr, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, KAIST Urban Design Lab, Daejeon 34141, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Kim, Y (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, KAIST Smart City Res Ctr, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, KAIST Urban Design Lab, Daejeon 34141, South Korea.",sunghee_lee@kaist.ac.kr; youngchulkim@kaist.ac.kr,"KIM, Youngchul/C-3814-2013","KIM, Youngchul/0000-0001-7945-028X","Urban Declining Area Regenerative Capacity-Enhancing Technology Research Program [21TSRD-B151228-03]; Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport in Korea [21UMRG-B158194-02]","Urban Declining Area Regenerative Capacity-Enhancing Technology Research Program; Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport in Korea","This research was supported by a grant (21TSRD-B151228-03) from the Urban Declining Area Regenerative Capacity-Enhancing Technology Research Program and by the Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) grant (21UMRG-B158194-02) funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport in Korea.",,91,5,6,20,65,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1618-8667,1610-8167,,URBAN FOR URBAN GREE,Urban For.

The Copenhagen Accord targets up to US$50 billion per year in adaptation funding, but commitments to date have been trivial compared to what is needed. Although there are some studies and suggestions, it remains unclear where the money will come from and how it will be disbursed. Beyond this, many development experts believe that the main hurdle in climate adaptation is effective implementation. A framework, based on the polluter pays principle, is presented here regarding the mobilization of resources for adaptation in developing countries using market mechanisms. It is assumed that mitigation and adaptation are at least partly fungible in terms of long-term global societal costs and benefits, and that quantifying climate vulnerability reductions is possible at least sometimes. The scheme's benefits include significant, equitable and flexible capital flows, and improved and more efficient resource allocation and verification procedures that incentivize sustained project management. Challenges include overcoming political resistance to historical responsibility-based obligations and scepticism of market instruments, and, critically, quantifying climate impact costs and verifying investments for vulnerability reduction credits.","Climate Mitigat Works Ltd, London N1 4EG, England",,"Schultz, KH (corresponding author), Climate Mitigat Works Ltd, POB 46555, London N1 4EG, England.",karl@climate-mitigation.com,"Schultz, Karl H./P-1640-2018","Schultz, Karl H./0000-0002-2184-4582",,,,,24,9,10,2,28,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

There is a pressing need to develop a robust management strategy via enhancing the resiliency of the community, particularly in the context of complex urban environments, like Jakarta. Resilience is conceptualized within specific contexts and uniquely tailored to the targeted setting, yet research regarding the operational concept of a flood-resilient community in the context of Jakarta remains limited. This paper will elaborate this operational concept through understanding the desirable features and influential barriers of a flood-resilient community through the lenses of three main stakeholder groups: disaster risk reduction (DRR), climate change adaptation (CCA), and development. It will also discuss the ways in which the synergies that exist across these groups can be enhanced. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were applied in this study, and multiple sources of data were used. The findings indicate that these groups share common views regarding the importance of human aspects being central to resilience building efforts.

Natural World Heritage sites represent a treasure to be managed and sustained for all humankind. Each World Heritage site is so designated on the basis of one or more Outstanding Universal Values. Because climate change impacts are site-specific, adaptation to sustain Universal Values also must be specific. As such, climate change adaptation is a wicked problem, with no clear action strategies available. Further, adaptation resources are limited at every site. Each site management team must decide which adaptations are appropriate investments. A triage approach guides that evaluation. Some impacts will be so large and/or uncertain that the highest probability of adaptation success comes from a series of uncertain actions that reduce investment risk. Others will be small, certain, comfortable and yet have low probable impact on the Universal Value. A triage approach guides the management team toward highest probable return on investment, involving stakeholders from the surrounding landscape, advancing engagement and communication, and increasing transparency and accountability.","[Perry, Jim] Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, 2003 Upper Buford Circle, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Perry, J (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, 2003 Upper Buford Circle, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",Jperry@umn.edu,,,University of Minnesota,University of Minnesota(University of Minnesota System),This research was funded by the University of Minnesota.,,56,5,5,0,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,SEP,2019,7,9,,,,,,,105,10.3390/cli7090105,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli7090105,,,10,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,JA7FZ,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000488008500014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, the current engagement with collective adaptation suffers from a few shortcomings: While the debate has been normative for the largest part, a coherent conceptual framing and theoretical engagement have been underdeveloped, hampering the empirical assessment of the extent and patterns of collective adaptation as well as the factors that foster or hinder it. In addition, the majority of emerging empirical assessments are concerned with rather homogenous sociocultural communities, while collective adaptation in heterogeneous settings such as urban melting pots has been far less in the focus - even though the most heterogeneous neighborhoods are often those with the highest vulnerability, least resources and gravest lack of formal adaptation. Sociocultural diversity has the potential to foster resilience through integrating a multitude of perspectives but, at the same time, presents a challenge for trust-building and collaboration. The paper develops and illustrates a heuristic conceptual framework on different types of collective adaptation and their formation as well as mobilization in socioculturally diverse settings. It is meant to help guide future research and inform policy debates in what is a critical decade for climate change adaptation, particularly in an increasingly diverse world.","[Wannewitz, Mia; Garschagen, Matthias] Ludwig Maximilians Univ LMU, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Wannewitz, M (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ LMU, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",mia.wannewitz@lmu.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01LN1710A1],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"Funding source This research was conducted in the frame of the TRA-NSCEND project (01LN1710A1) , funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.",,94,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1877-3435,1877-3443,,CURR OPIN ENV SUST,Curr.

Using survey data collected from a sample of 450 farm households in the agricultural year 2012-2013, we identify farm household types through cluster analysis and apply them in the simulation model. From the results, we conclude that at their current costs, soil and water conservation techniques and irrigation can on average provide higher income even under climate change.

Nevertheless, aquaculture in Bangladesh has faced recent concerns due to climate change. Aquaculture is vulnerable to a combination of climatic factors, such as global warming, rainfall variation, flood, drought, temperature fluctuation, and salinity change. Considering the vulnerability of fish production to the impacts of climate change, tilapia farming is one of the possible strategies for adaptation to climate change. The positive culture attributes of tilapia are their tolerance to low water levels and poor water quality with rainfall variation, temperature fluctuation, and salinity change. In fact, tilapia farming is possible in a wide range of water environments, including freshwater, brackish water, and saltwater conditions. We suggest that appropriate tilapia culture strategies with institutional support and collaboration with key stakeholders are needed for adaptation to environmental change.","[Rahman, Mohammad Lutfar; Shahjahan, Md] Bangladesh Agr Univ, Dept Fisheries Management, Lab Fish Ecophysiol, Mymensingh 2202, Bangladesh; [Rahman, Mohammad Lutfar] Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agr Univ, Dept Genet & Fish Breeding, Gazipur 1706, Bangladesh; [Ahmed, Nesar] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU); Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University (BSMRAU); Deakin University,"Ahmed, N (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",mlrahman@bsmrau.edu.bd; mdshahjahan@bau.edu.bd; n.ahmed@deakin.edu.au,,"Md, Shahjahan/0000-0003-1097-8849; Ahmed, Nesar/0000-0003-4133-697X; Rahman, Mohammad/0000-0002-8140-0713",,,,,173,9,10,7,24,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2021,13,14,,,,,,,7657,10.3390/su13147657,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13147657,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TO4VZ,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000676912600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Wealth inequalities among individuals and localities already are translating-and will continue to translate-into inequalities between the rich and poor in their capacity to adapt. Current federal disaster aid programs and policies exacerbate these inequalities by favoring the wealthy, and future government resource management decisions and investments also may broaden the gap between rich and poor in terms of the economic and other costs they will bear from climate change. Some have suggested broadening Takings Clause liability as a means to address the problem of inequality and climate change adaptation. However, these suggested doctrinal reforms, if anything, would skew government actors to provide even greater protection to wealthy communities and even less to low-income ones. Broadening the public trust doctrine could help address some of the inequality problems associated with climate change, but the most important reforms needed involve the integration of equality analysis and equality concerns into all levels of administrative decision-making.

Results indicate that sector policies currently only partially support shifts towards CCD, with approaches that both complement and detract from CCD being prioritized by national governments. Agriculture offers the greatest number of potentially viable approaches capable of achieving the development, adaptation and mitigation aims inherent in CCD, while energy the least. National governments should focus on developing coherent, cross-sector approaches that deliver such potential triple wins in order to promote new forms of inclusive and sustainable economic and social development, whilst facilitating adaptation to climate change impacts and supporting mitigation activities.

In order to make reasoned decisions to adapt to climate change managers require knowledge of the role of temperature and precipitation in SWE development and data to distinguish the relative retention response of snowpack regions to expected temperature and precipitation regime shifts at the watershed scale. Using the Daymet interpolated 1 km(2) dataset, effects of elevation, temperature (T-max, T-min and T-avg) and precipitation on April 1 SWE in the Crown of the Continent were tested by linear regression and Kendall correlation. Changes in Daymet estimated snow water equivalent (SWE) in response to increased temperatures and changes in precipitation were estimated in two ways: 1) comparing April 1SWE in the 11 warmest (mean T-max February) and driest (mean precipitation January to March) years with the 22 cooler/wetter years 1981-2013 and 2) SWE retention from April 1 to June 1 over the period 1980 to 2013 across 120 watersheds in a major continental headwater region, the Crown of the Continent of North America. Historical analysis of period warm year April 1 SWE was assumed to indicate the recent impact of warmer winter temperatures. Changes in snowpack April 1 to June 1 reflected likely effects on peak runoff and were, therefore, also relevant for future climate change adaptation considerations. Winter (JFM) precipitation proved more influential than temperature in shaping April 1 SWE response at the regional scale. Of the three factors, elevation was most positively associated with April 1 SWE at the watershed scale. Temperature and precipitation influenced SWE accumulation and persistence at the watershed scale, but higher precipitation was more closely associated with higher April 1 SWE retention. Ranking of watershed snowpack retention in warm and dry years, combined with spring snowpack retention offers data to assist identification of watersheds with greatest snowpack persistence in the face of anticipated climate change effects.","[Broberg, Len] Univ Montana, Environm Studies Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA",University of Montana System; University of Montana,"Broberg, L (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Environm Studies Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",len.broberg@umontana.edu,,,"LB, Crown Managers Partnership","LB, Crown Managers Partnership","LB, Crown Managers Partnership, https://www.crownmanagers.org/.The funders assisted in GIS data collection.",,80,1,1,1,2,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,APR 13,2021,16,4,,,,,,,e0248736,10.1371/journal.pone.0248736,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248736,,,19,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,RN5ED,33848296,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000640373500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The potential for disasters to act as focusing events for policy change, including adaptation to climate change risk, is well known. Moreover, local action is an important element of climate change adaptation and related risk management efforts. As such, there is a good reason to expect local communities to mobilize in response to disaster events, both with immediate response and recovery-focused activities, as well as longer-term preparedness and adaptation-focused public policy changes. However, scholars also note that the experience of disaster does not always yield policy change; indeed, disasters can also result in policy inertia and failure, perhaps as often or more often than major policy change. This study poses two key research questions. First, we ask to what degree policy change occurs in communities impacted by an extreme weather event. Second, we seek to understand the conditions that lead to adaptation-oriented policy adoption in response to an extreme weather event. Our results suggest two main recipes for future-oriented policy adoption in the wake of an extreme weather event. For both recipes, a high-impact event is a necessary condition for future-oriented policy adoption. In the first recipe for change, policy adoption occurs in Democratic communities with highly focused media attention. The second, less expected recipe for change involves Republican communities that have experienced other uncommon weather events in the recent past. We use a comparative case approach with 15 cases and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis methods. Our approach adds to the existing literature on policy change and local adaptation by selecting a mid-N range of cases where extreme weather events have the potential to act as focusing events, thereby sidestepping selection on the dependent variable. Our approach also takes advantage of a novel method for measuring attention, the latent Dirichlet allocation approach.","[Giordono, Leanne; Boudet, Hilary] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Gard-Murray, Alexander] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Oregon State University; Harvard University,"Giordono, L (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",giordonl@oregonstate.edu,"Gard-Murray, Alexander/CAH-3914-2022","Gard-Murray, Alexander/0000-0002-6080-8517; Giordono, Leanne/0000-0002-7412-3340","National Science Foundation, Sociology Program [1357055]","National Science Foundation, Sociology Program","We greatly appreciate the contributions made by our interview participants.

In response to the adverse effects of climate change and variability, a National Adaptation Programme of Action is used as framework for implementing adaptation programmes. However, this framework puts limited significance on indigenous knowledge systems (IKS). In many parts of the world, IKS have shown potential in the development of locally relevant and therefore sustainable adaptation strategies. This study was aimed at assessing the role of IKS in adaptation to climate change and variability in the agricultural sector in a rural district of Chikhwawa, southern Malawi. The study used both qualitative data from focus group and key informant interviews and quantitative data from household interviews and secondary data to address the research objectives. The study established that the local communities are able to recognise the changes in their climate and local environment. Commonly mentioned indicators of changing climatic patterns included delayed and unpredictable onset of rainfall, declining rainfall trends, warming temperatures and increased frequency of prolonged dry spells. An analysis of empirical data corroborates the people's perception. In addition, the community is able to use their IKS to adapt their agricultural systems to partially offset the effects of climate change. Like vulnerability to climate change, IKS varies over a short spatial scale, providing locally relevant adaptation to impacts of climate change.

Using a systematic review approach, this paper aims to present an improved understanding of how different climate change events have impacted on people's health and/or wellbeing. A thorough review of 93 articles following a PRISMA and SALSA protocol revealed nine climate change events, of which heat waves and extreme ambient temperature were found to be closely associated with the most cited illnesses, including physical problems and failure of one's circulatory and respiratory systems. Age and gender are the critical factors among others that differentiate the effects of climate change on health. Although the formulation of heatwave response plans has been adopted in many countries, the findings of this study suggest that design for climate-adaptive built environments is of paramount importance. This paper provides insights into climate change adaption strategies from a health perspective. The findings can be used by disaster risk reduction (DRR) policymakers and practitioners to identify the areas to target in their climate change agenda in order to enhance the adaptive ability of communities.","[Liu, Fengxuan; Chang-Richards, Alice; Dirks, Kim Natasha] Univ Auckland, Fac Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Auckland, New Zealand; [Wang, Kevin I-Kai] Univ Auckland, Fac Engn, Dept Elect Comp & Software Engn, Auckland, New Zealand; [Liu, Fengxuan] Engn Bldg 405,5 Grafton Rd,Auckland Cent, Auckland 1010, New Zealand",University of Auckland; University of Auckland,"Liu, FX (corresponding author), Engn Bldg 405,5 Grafton Rd,Auckland Cent, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.",fliu104@aucklanduni.ac.nz,,"Dirks, Kim/0000-0003-4371-1323",,,,,113,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0968-0802,1099-1719,,SUSTAIN DEV,Sustain.

Its impact on agricultural activities in developing countries has increased dramatically. Understanding how farmers perceive climate change and how they adapt to it is very important to the implementation of adequate policies for agricultural and food security. This paper aims to contribute to an understanding of farmers' adaptation choices, determinants of the adaptation choices and the long-term implications of the adaptation choices. Data were collected from 120 respondents in the Zou Department of Benin. A binary logit model was used to analyze the factors influencing household decisions to adapt to climate change. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was estimated to analyze the factors influencing households' choice of adaptation strategies to climate change. The results show that farmers have a developed perception of climate change. These changes are translated by rainfall disturbances (rainfall delays, early cessation, bad rainfall distribution etc.), shortening of the small dry season, increasing of temperature and sometimes, violent winds. The survey reveals that Benin farmers adopt many strategies in response to climate change. These strategies include Crop-livestock diversification and other good practices (mulching, organic fertilizer), Use of improved varieties, chemical fertilizers and pesticides, Agroforestry and perennial plantation and Diversification of income-generating activities. The findings also reveal that most of the respondents use these strategies in combination. From the binary logit model, we know that farming experience and educational level of household head positively influence adaptation decisions. The result of the multinomial logit analysis shows that farming experience, educational level, farm size and gender have a significant impact on climate change adaptation strategies. Based on in-depth analysis of each strategy, we identify crop diversification and agroforestry as being the most promising strategies with benefits for farmers, the environment and future generations.","[Fadina, Adegnandjou Mahouna Roland; Barjolle, Dominique] ETH, Dept Environm Syst Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Barjolle, D (corresponding author), ETH, Dept Environm Syst Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",rolandfadina@gmail.com; barjolle@ethz.ch,,,,,,,45,68,68,2,14,MDPI AG,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-3298,,,ENVIRONMENTS,Environments,JAN,2018,5,1,,,,,,,15,10.3390/environments5010015,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/environments5010015,,,17,Environmental Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FU8OU,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000424113800014,View Full Record in Web of Science

The segmental analysis was based on a nationally representative sample of 3,993 farmers concerned with farmer adaptation of climate risks. The resulting data were subjected to two-step cluster analysis to identify homogenous groups of farmers based on factors related to climate change adaptation. A three-cluster solution was identified wherein farmers were distinguishable on the basis of belief in climate change, desire for financial assistance and advice, social connectedness, information seeking, and adverse farm conditions. The largest group (Cluster 1: 55%) was characterized by farmers who recognized being affected by drought and drying and who were actively engaged in adaptive practices, despite the fact that they had little income and poor farm resources. One third of these farmers reported that their health was a barrier to sustained activity in farming. Cluster 2 (26%) was characterized by farmers not readily affected by drying, who enjoyed good incomes, good health and better farming conditions. They expressed little desire to adapt. The smallest cluster (Cluster 3: 19%) was also characterized by farmers who recognized that they were affected by drying. However, despite a desire to adapt, they had very little means to do so. They reported the poorest natural resources and the poorest health, despite being younger. The findings suggest that it is the intent to adapt, starting from where people are at, which is a more important indicator of the capacity to work towards sustainable practices than assets tests alone.","[Hogan, Anthony; Bode, Adam] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Sociol, Coll Arts & Social Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Berry, Helen] Univ Canberra, Ctr Res & Act Publ Hlth, Bruce, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University; University of Canberra,"Hogan, A (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Sch Sociol, Coll Arts & Social Sci, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",anthony.hogan@anu.edu.au; adam@ancd.org.au; helen.berry@canberra.edu.au,,"Bode, Adam/0000-0003-4593-5179",,,,,31,20,20,1,27,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

As a means of investigation, the deductive method and documental research were adopted. Furthermore, the research has a basic nature and an exploratory objective. As a result, the research concluded that municipalities must play an important role in adapting water resources to climate change, especially in 'no regrets' measures.

This paper examines the methods of adaptation to climate change used by smallholder farmers and their impacts on household food security. The necessity to adapt to climate change is caused by a combination of sensitivity and exposure and the success in doing so depends on adaptive capacity. Household food security was determined using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS). Of the surveyed households, 95 % were aware that climate is changing and expected severe impacts on their crop production systems. Households undertake crop and soil management practices in order to respond to the changing climate. About 83 % of households anticipated that they would alter their livelihoods systems in response to climate change, with 59 % of households indicating that government grants would play an important role in this. Of those assessed, 97 % were severely food insecure and the remaining 3 % were moderately food insecure. Householders were worried about the negative impacts of climate change which included droughts, floods and soil erosion. Householders who were vulnerable to climate change recorded high levels of food insecurity. Decline in prices of farm products, increases in costs of farm inputs and anxiety over occurrence of livestock diseases exacerbated household food insecurity. Information will play a critical role in mitigating the impacts of climate change on household food security but farmers should also be assisted with appropriate input packages, such as seeds and fertilizers that can help them adapt effectively.","[Shisanya, Stephen; Mafongoya, Paramu] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Shisanya, S (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa.",sshisanya@gmail.com,,,University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN); Water Research Commission (WRC),University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN); Water Research Commission (WRC),University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) and Water Research Commission (WRC) for funding the study.,,24,26,28,4,43,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1876-4517,1876-4525,,FOOD SECUR,Food Secur.,JUN,2016,8,3,,,,,597,608,,10.1007/s12571-016-0569-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-016-0569-7,,,12,Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Food Science & Technology,DQ4LN,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000379175500012,View Full Record in Web of Science

We collected quantitative data in the district of Ilam via 91 farmers through a questionnaire survey and applied descriptive statistics, multiple regression, and binary logistic regression models to analyze the collected data. Findings revealed that information sources (peer exchange, internet, and training attendance), as well as institutional factors (cooperative membership and credit access), positively influenced the degree of climate change adaptation among the respondents. Easier credit access and joining cooperatives could enhance the adaptative capacity of smallholder tea farmers. Improving the interaction between the Nepalese government and stakeholders involved in the domestic tea value chain could also increase economic success.","[Muench, Steffen; Bavorova, Miroslava] Czech Univ Life Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Pradhan, Prajal] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Bavorova, M (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci, Prague, Czech Republic.",bavorova@ftz.czu.cz,"Muench, Steffen/AAL-2896-2021; Pradhan, Prajal/ABE-2912-2020","Muench, Steffen/0000-0002-6944-7578; Pradhan, Prajal/0000-0003-0491-5489; Bavorova, Miroslava/0000-0001-8102-9304","Faculty of Tropical AgriSciences of the Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague [IGA 20205010]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01DP17035, 01LS1906A]",Faculty of Tropical AgriSciences of the Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"We would like to express our gratitude to the Faculty of Tropical AgriSciences of the Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague for financially supporting this research (IGA 20205010).

In this paper, we presented the development process, main contents, significance, and limitations of the 3rd Adaptation Plan as a helpful case for the international community to consult in formulating their national adaptation plans. The plan aims to implement a climate-safe nation with the people, and its development process features a scientific evidence basis and participation of various parties. It systematically and organically recommends 232 measures to be implemented by the Korean government and related departments for the next five years to enhance the adaptive capacity to 84 climate risks. Through expert forums, working council on climate change adaptation, adaptation governance forums, online public hearings, and discussion on preparing public-oriented countermeasures, 41 representative public-oriented tasks in eight sectors were selected. The plan consists of measures to resolve national climate risks constructed based on scientific evidence. All adaptation parties participated in the entire process of establishing the adaptation plan and evaluating its implementation. Significantly, the 3rd Adaptation Plan attempts to overcome the limitations of the 2nd adaptation plan by planning for the operation of a citizen evaluation group. However, the plan's limitations have been identified as insufficient willingness to monitor and implement measures, differences in the spectrum of adaptation measures by a government department, and lack of publicity in the English language. The measures to deal with these shortcomings are being sought. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The adaptive capacity of livelihoods largely defines the extent to which people can cope with future environmental changes, whether caused by climate change or other factors such as land use changes and water resources development. This article analyses the resilience and adaptive capacity of rural livelihoods around Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake, an exceptional lake-floodplain system dominated by flood pulse. The research findings demonstrate that despite the people's tradition of adapting to the remarkable seasonal variation of water and related resources, their capacity to adapt to unusual environmental changes is weak, with the poorest being clearly the most vulnerable group. Reasons for the weak resilience include villages' relatively homogenous livelihood structures, unjust governance practices, increasing inequality and the lack of opportunities for livelihood diversification. It is concluded that while climate change is likely to pose a remarkable challenge to people's livelihoods in the longer term, climate change adaptation activities should also take into account other environmental changes. Equally critical is the understanding of the broader socio-political context and its dynamics in increasing-and decreasing-livelihood resilience.","[Nuorteva, Paula; Keskinen, Marko; Varis, Olli] Aalto Univ, Water & Dev Res Grp, Aalto 00076, Finland",Aalto University,"Keskinen, M (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Water & Dev Res Grp, POB 15200, Aalto 00076, Finland.",keskinen@iki.fi,"Varis, Olli/G-6506-2011; Keskinen, Marko/B-2886-2012","Varis, Olli/0000-0001-9231-4549; Keskinen, Marko/0000-0001-5236-2327",Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland; Maa- ja vesitekniikan tuki ry,Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland; Maa- ja vesitekniikan tuki ry,"The research presented in this article formed a part of the research project Water and Climate Change in the Lower Mekong Basin.

The result falsifies the research hypothesis since uncertainty aversion has no effect, whereas risk aversion has a negative impact on the decision to adapt. We argue that risk of any change in the business-as-usual is higher than the expected risk of climate change impact in Central European forestry. We conclude that having access to novel information about expected impacts of climate change, taking into account institutional challenges and supportive experiences about useful adaptation strategies, may convince forestry professionals to adapt in the future.","[Brunette, M.] Univ Lorraine, Univ Strasbourg, BETA, AgroParisTech,CNRS,INRAE, Nancy, France; [Brunette, M.] Climate Econ Chair CEC, Paris, France; [Hanewinkel, M.; Yousefpour, R.] Univ Freiburg, Forestry Econ & Forest Planning, Freiburg, Germany",AgroParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Universite de Lorraine; University of Freiburg,"Brunette, M (corresponding author), Univ Lorraine, Univ Strasbourg, BETA, AgroParisTech,CNRS,INRAE, Nancy, France.;Brunette, M (corresponding author), Climate Econ Chair CEC, Paris, France.",marielle.brunette@inrae.fr; marc.hanewinkel@ife.uni-freiburg.de; rasoul.youseour@ife.uni-freiburg.de,"hanewinkel, marc/E-5639-2011","hanewinkel, marc/0000-0003-4081-6621; Brunette, Marielle/0000-0001-8192-4819","French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the Investissements d'Avenir program, Lab of Excellence ARBRE [ANR-11-LABX-0002-01]","French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the Investissements d'Avenir program, Lab of Excellence ARBRE(French National Research Agency (ANR))","This work was supported by a grant overseen by the French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the Investissements d'Avenir program (ANR-11-LABX-0002-01, Lab of Excellence ARBRE).",,49,9,9,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Hazards (e.g. storms, coastal flooding, sea level rise, heat waves) combine with vulnerabilities (e.g. socioeconomic disparity, rapid urbanization, improper land use, rigid governance structures) to increase disaster risk in some coastal cities. Focus on climate change adaptation (CCA) has been increasing as part of the answer to this problem. However, CCA has regularly developed separately from relatively established disaster management efforts, and this paper argues that CCA should generally be included as part of disaster management efforts, utilizing extant social structures, funding streams, theories, and more to avoid duplication of effort. Building on this conceptual foundation, the paper presents a framework for guiding and assessing efforts to reduce this risk. The framework was based on theory, then modified during a case study of NewYork City. This allowed refinement based on real-world planning, resulting in a theoretically grounded framework with a strong focus on application. Key points from the investigation are summarized here, interesting themes are discussed, and notes on applying the framework are presented.","[Wallace, Ben] Univ Delaware, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Newark, DE 19716 USA",University of Delaware,"Wallace, B (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",benw@udel.edu,,,,,,,38,11,11,1,26,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1747-7891,1878-0059,,ENVIRON HAZARDS-UK,Environ.

Design/methodology/approach The study was conducted in Kweneng district, located in the south eastern part of Botswana. Multi-stage sampling was used to obtain a representative sample from three sub-districts in the district. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data by using face-to-face interviews. Findings Majority of farmers perceived an increase in mean annual temperature and the number of hot days and a decrease in mean annual rainfall and the number of rainfall days over the past 10 years as indicators of climate change. The prominent adaptation strategies included changes in planting dates for crops and supplementary feeding for livestock. The logistic regression results show that gender, age, household size, poverty, shortage of land, mixed farming and knowledge about climate change significantly influence adaptation. Practical implications The findings indicate that climate change policy should target agricultural diversification at the household level and dissemination of information on climate change and adaptation strategies. Originality/value Policy recommendations can be suggested: government climate change interventions should target agricultural diversification at the household level, and this study provides insights on what influences adaptation strategies and what should be targeted to build resilience in the agricultural sector.","[Kgosikoma, Keneilwe Ruth; Lekota, Phatsimo Cotildah] Botswana Univ Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Agr Econ Educ & Extens, Fac Agr, Gaborone, Botswana; [Kgosikoma, Olaotswe Ernest] Minist Agr Dev & Food Secur, Agr Res Dept, Gaborone, Botswana",,"Kgosikoma, KR (corresponding author), Botswana Univ Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Agr Econ Educ & Extens, Fac Agr, Gaborone, Botswana.",kkgosikoma@gmail.com; phatsimocotildahlekota@yahoo.com; kkgosikoma@gmail.com,"Kgosikoma, Keneilwe/AFU-4799-2022",,,,,,50,19,21,1,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

In this paper, real options are explained and applied to several examples by developing a new type of decision diagram. The diagrams are a language for thinking about complex decisions under risk. Farmers, community leaders, and catchment management authorities can develop similar diagrams and use them to communicate with other decision makers and with researchers. Finally, the decision diagrams are related to new mathematical tools to help find optimal decisions for managing climate risks.","Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Hertzler, G (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",Greg.Hertzler@uwa.edu.au,,,,,,,10,36,36,1,26,CSIRO PUBLISHING,COLLINGWOOD,"150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD, VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA",0004-9409,,,AUST J AGR RES,Aust.

Degraded-mangrove and agriculture (rice-based systems and aquaculture) exist side by side, each having their specific challenges and opportunities. In this review, we analyzed challenges faced by this unique ecosystem along with opportunities derived from technological advancement and site-specific climate change adaptation strategies. Both the mangrove and lowland rice ecosystem could act as carbon (C) sink to the tune of 27 and 0.93 t ha(-1) per annum, respectively. Apart from C sequestration, mangrove-rice systems provide many ecosystem services. However, 40% of tropical and 10.5% of Sundarban mangroves (between 1930 and 2013), have been lost due to climate change induced sea-level rise, extreme weather events and human interferences. The specific challenges in this system are freshwater scarcity, high salinity, insufficient real-time seed supply, poor fertilizer-management, lack of irrigation network, and unprecedented occurrence of extreme events which seriously hamper the productivity of mangrove, rice, and aquaculture. There also exist some unique opportunities in terms of cheap labour availability, mangrove-conservation acts, cheap river-communication, and scope of ecotourism which fortunately get the attention of national and international funding agencies. In the last section of this review, we recommended ten climate change adaptation strategies that may be considered at the policy and farmer levels. The strategies broadly include the development of small-scale rainwater harvesting structures in series, the introduction of salt tolerant cultivars with water management, land shaping, establishment of multipurpose cyclone shelter at each block and empowerment of women through self-help groups.","[Padhy, S.

With 47 of the state's 57 coal mines impacted by the 2010-2011 floods, vast infrastructure damage, lost export earnings of more than $2 billion, and consequent impacts on surrounding socioeconomic and ecological landscapes, the case demonstrates the industry's vulnerability to climatic changes and the importance of planned adaptation for its future viability. As mineral resources are embedded within the landscape, adaptation must necessarily be in situ. The article draws lessons from the case to better inform sector-wide strategies for in situ adaptation. The findings are relevant to other industry sectors, such as tourism and forestry, where geographical relocation is not an available adaptation strategy.","[Sharma, Vigya; Franks, Daniel M.] Univ Queensland, Ctr Social Responsibil Min, Sustainable Minerals Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Sharma, V (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Ctr Social Responsibil Min, Sustainable Minerals Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",v.sharma@uq.edu.au,"Franks, Daniel M/F-8505-2012","Franks, Daniel M/0000-0003-1217-2128",,,,,71,15,15,1,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0894-1920,1521-0723,,SOC NATUR RESOUR,Soc.

The paper contributes to shed light on the role of fiscal policy in climate-change adaptation, which aims at containing the economic damage of climate change. We use an overlapping generations (OLG) model for a small open economy in which adaptation reflects the extent to which public policies reduce the negative influence of climate change on the capital depreciation rate. Adaptation includes both preventive measures, i.e. investment in infrastructure, and remedial measures, i.e. post-disaster relief and reconstruction. Through model simulations we assess the costs and benefits of both remedial and preventive actions. We find that preventive intervention leads to higher GDP growth rates than either taking no action or waiting until remedial action is necessary. However, the evidence shows that, due to high costs of early adaptation and budgetary constraints, countries tend to focus on late corrective actions, also relying on international assistance. Given the expected increase in climate-related risks, a comprehensive strategy including both preventive and corrective actions would be desirable to strengthen resilience to shocks and alleviate the financial constraints, which particularly affect small countries.

Design/methodology/approach The paper draws on data collected from a qualitative research design that used participatory rural appraisal methods, particularly, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and seasonal calendar analysis in three selected rural communities of the Sissala East District. Furthermore, an inter-generational framework was adopted for comparative assessment of vulnerability and changes in vulnerability to climate change. Findings The results show that the current generation of smallholder farmers is more vulnerable to climate change than the past generation, the era of grandparents. Thus, farmers are exposed to higher-intensity sunshine, temperature and wind in contemporary times than was the case in the past. Consequently, their livelihoods are affected the most by the damaging effects of these climatic hazards. The CRA process revealed the relevance of indigenous knowledge systems for vulnerability assessments and at the same time, underpins the need for adaptation of such knowledge if it is to sustain smallholder farmer efforts at climate change adaptation at community levels. Originality/value This paper will contribute to climate change research in two ways: first, by drawing attention to the usefulness of CRA in vulnerability assessment; and second, by focusing on climate elements which are critical for CCAP but rarely given sufficient attention in vulnerability assessments.","[File, Dramani J.

We analyze programs in each of the four nations and interview data from non-governmental organizers, local journalists, a social entrepreneur in India, one program manager who worked both in Vietnam and Thailand, and one strategic planner. While the programs we examine in this study are relatively new, and thus their long-term effects are as yet unknowable, our preliminary findings indicate that through technology and innovation, practical skills enhancements, and connections with local non- governmental organizations (NGO)-centered CCA projects, women have the potential to increase their political involvement and social status within their communities. While these experiences should provide women with more skills to enhance their social status, multiple structural factors in the regions on which we focused may impede women's political participation. We find that work-around strategies introduced in CCA programs may enable women to achieve greater autonomy. Correspondingly, NGO programs and interventions should be more successful when the state officially acknowledges gender equality and women's rights.","[Christoff, Peggy Spitzer; Lu, Min-Huei; Sommer, Jamie M.] SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Lewis, Nancy Davis] East West Ctr, Honolulu, HI USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; East West Center,"Christoff, PS (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",peggy.christoff@stonybrook.edu; lewisn@eastwesrcenter.org; min.lu@stonybrook.edu; jamie.sommer@stonybrook.edu,,,"College of Arts and Sciences faculty in the Fine Arts, Humanities, and (lettered) Social Sciences (FAHSS) Fund","College of Arts and Sciences faculty in the Fine Arts, Humanities, and (lettered) Social Sciences (FAHSS) Fund","The research project was sponsored in part by a summer research grant from the College of Arts and Sciences faculty in the Fine Arts, Humanities, and (lettered) Social Sciences (FAHSS) Fund.",,24,4,4,0,26,SOOKMYUNG WOMENS UNIV,YOUNGSAK-KU,"RES INST ASIAN WOMEN, CHEONGPA-RO 47NA-GIL36, YOUNGSAK-KU, SEOUL 04309, SOUTH KOREA",1225-925X,2586-5714,,ASIAN WOMEN,Asian Women,JUN,2017,33,2,,,,,1,22,,,,,,22,Women's Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Women's Studies,EZ3FO,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000404596600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is the case because of the advancement of science, because of user demand and because of the central role played by climate prediction in guiding adaptation policy. But are probabilities what climate policy really needs? This article reviews three key questions: (1) Why might we (not) need probabilities of climate change? (2) What are the problems in estimating probabilities? (3) How are researchers estimating probabilities? These questions are analysed within the context of adaptation to climate change. Overall, we conclude that the jury is still out on whether probabilities are useful for climate adaptation policy. The answer is highly context dependent and thus is a function of the goals and motivation of the policy analysis, the unit of analysis, timescale and the training of the analyst. Probability assessment in the context of climate change is always subjective, conditional and provisional. There are various problems in estimating the probability of future climate change, but reflexive human behaviour (i.e. actions explicitly influenced by information) is largely intractable in the context of prediction. Nonetheless, there is considerable scope to develop novel methodologies that combine conditional probabilities with scenarios and which are relevant for climate decision-making.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Dessai, S (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",s.dessai@uea.ac.uk,"Hulme, Mike/F-9012-2010; Dessai, Suraje/D-4219-2009","Hulme, Mike/0000-0002-1273-7662; Dessai, Suraje/0000-0002-7879-9364",,,,,126,314,318,0,64,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

CBIs can also be integrated into the Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) agenda. The paper explores the extent to which CBIs promote the mainstreaming of CCA into DRR. Primary data were obtained from interviews with representatives of CBIs and supporting organisations in three local governments of the Hunter Valley (New South Wales, Australia). Findings show that CBIs recognise the potential contribution of climate change in modifying the local hazard profile. CBIs mainstream CCA into DRR by following four approaches: environmental and social justice; sustainability and transition; ecosystem-based approach; and adaptive planning. Partnerships were identified both among CBIs and between CBIs and City Councils; however, conflicts between CBIs, City Councils and business actors emerged, and a lack of commitment by multi-level governments in responding to climate change was revealed. The findings show that CBIs consider CCA and DRR within a broad everyday context related to vulnerability and local development. But we argue that assigning responsibility for climate change issues to CBIs is not a panacea and should not be the only local climate change response. Instead, CBIs need to be included in a larger and long-term commitment by actors that possess access to resources, such as higher levels of government. The paper provides a local Australian perspective on the effectiveness of mainstreaming CCA into DRR and furthers the conversation for the benefit of other communities facing similar challenges.","[Forino, Giuseppe; Brewer, Graham] Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Univ Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [von Meding, Jason] Univ Florida, Florida Inst Built Environm Resilience, Gainesville, FL USA",University of Newcastle; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Forino, G (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Univ Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",g.forino@gmail.com,,"forino, giuseppe/0000-0001-6659-0742",University of Newcastle (Australia),University of Newcastle (Australia),"The Authors warmly express their gratitude to all the participants and the key informants who dedicated time to this research.

This study aimed to examine the carbon sequestration potential of community-managed Shorea robusta (Sal) forest and assess the practices that have the potential to reduce adverse climate change impacts, thereby improving the livelihoods of forest-based communities. For this, we obtained forest inventory-derived carbon data from 11 sample plots of Shorea robusta (Sal) forest, analyzed them using allometric equations, and estimated the carbon storage and climate change mitigation potential of these forests, while focus group discussions and desk review of secondary information were employed to investigate the adaptation potential. The results show that the estimated biomass density of the selected forest is 352.46 +/- 63.79 t/ha, whereas the carbon stock density is 165.66 +/- 29.98 t/ha and the CO2 equivalent is 598.07 +/- 110.48 t/ha. The study further revealed that community forest management, as a successful model of participatory forest management and community forest user group (CFUG) as a resourceful local institution, has been playing an important role in the diversification of livelihoods and income opportunities, social cohesion and thus climate change adaptation through collective actions. The adaptation and mitigation of climate change impacts have been prioritized in the operational plans of the CFUGs. Through the promotion and prioritization of alternative energy, agroforestry and enhanced livelihood options, the CFUGs are committed to the sustainable management of forest resources and to enhancing the livelihoods of local communities. This study indicates the relevance of community forests as a priority institution for the implementation of Local Adaptation Plans for Action (LAPA) and support National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA) to combat climatic impacts, providing important information for planners and policy makers in Nepal and elsewhere.","[Rijal, Sushila; Sinutok, Sutinee; Techato, Kuaanan] Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Environm Management, Hat Yai 90110, Thailand; [Sinutok, Sutinee] Prince Songkla Univ, Coastal Oceanog & Climate Change Res Ctr, Hat Yai 90110, Thailand; [Gentle, Popular] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia; [Gentle, Popular] Ipas Nepal, POB 11621, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal; [Khanal, Uttam] Precincts & Reg, Dept Jobs, Horsham, Vic 3400, Australia; [Gyawali, Saroj] Sustainable Study & Res Inst, Kathmandu 16, Kathmandu 44622, Nepal",Prince of Songkla University; Prince of Songkla University; Charles Sturt University,"Sinutok, S (corresponding author), Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Environm Management, Hat Yai 90110, Thailand.;Sinutok, S (corresponding author), Prince Songkla Univ, Coastal Oceanog & Climate Change Res Ctr, Hat Yai 90110, Thailand.",6210930019@email.psu.ac.th; ssutinee@gmail.com; kuaanan.t@psu.ac.th; gentle@ipas.org; uttam.khanal@agriculture.vic.gov.au; sgyawali@rdcnepal.org.np,"Sinutok, Sutinee/F-5311-2013","Khanal, Uttam/0000-0002-3946-0827; Techato, Kuaanan/0000-0002-9178-8416; Rijal, Sushila/0000-0003-0550-2846; Sinutok, Sutinee/0000-0002-1428-8477","Graduate School of Prince of Songkla University; Faculty of Environmental Management, Prince of Songkla University","Graduate School of Prince of Songkla University; Faculty of Environmental Management, Prince of Songkla University","This research was financially supported by the Graduate School of Prince of Songkla University and the Faculty of Environmental Management, Prince of Songkla University.",,84,1,1,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,FEB,2022,13,2,,,,,,,262,10.3390/f13020262,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13020262,,,15,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,4I1TW,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000850359900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While acting as the key nodes of globalisation and international business, seaports are exposed to the vulnerability of climate impacts, mainly because of their locations, including low-lying areas, coastal zones, and deltas. The paper is to develop a Climate Change Risk Indicator (CCRI) framework for climate risk assessment of seaports, enabling research-informed policymaking on such a demanding topic. Due to the increasing number of extreme weather events (EWEs), climate change adaptation is becoming an essential and necessary issue to be addressed by seaport stakeholders. Climate risk analysis aids rational adaptation planning. Many climate assessments have been done for measuring climate vulnerabilities, and various climate adaptation measures have been proposed for reducing climate risks. However, few of them used quantitative approaches for climate risk evaluations in seaports and fewer on the provisions of CCRIs for comparing climate risks of different locations and timeframes to guide rational policy making. Furthermore, climate change is a dynamic issue, requiring big objective data to support the analysis (e.g. monthly climate data on CCRIs) of climate threats and vulnerabilities. In this paper, Evidence Reasoning (ER) is employed to evaluate the climate risks in seaports by tackling the incomplete data. The findings reveal the quantitative measures of climate change risks in different locations and in different months. Furthermore, the risk levels of seaports in the future are assessed for observing the changes and informing policy making. The main contributions of this study include the visualisation of the comprehensive climate risk levels and provision of a new climate risk analysis framework through the comparison of climate change risks with respect to different locations and timeframes. Suitable climate adaptation measures can be chosen to implement, and seaports can cooperate on climate resilience issues (e.g. seaport network service and pre-disaster relief logistics).","[Poo, Mark Ching-Pong; Yang, Zaili] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Offshore & Marine Res Inst, Liverpool Logist, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Yang, Zaili; Jin, Zhihong] Dalian Maritime Univ, Logist Engn Coll, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zaili; Feng, Xuehao] Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Dimitriu, Delia] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Ecol & Environm Res Ctr, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Qu, Zhuohua] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Business Sch, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Liverpool John Moores University; Dalian Maritime University; Zhejiang University; Manchester Metropolitan University; Liverpool John Moores University; University of Liverpool,"Yang, ZL (corresponding author), Liverpool John Moores Univ, Offshore & Marine Res Inst, Liverpool Logist, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",Z.Yang@ljmu.ac.uk,"FENG, XUEHAO/M-8943-2018; yang, zaili/A-6493-2013; zhao, yang/GXF-4424-2022; Poo, Mark Ching-Pong/Q-2235-2017","yang, zaili/0000-0003-1385-493X; Poo, Mark Ching-Pong/0000-0002-9921-3107",EU H2020 ERC-COG-2019 project [TRUST -864724]; EU H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie project (GOLF MSCARISE) [777742],EU H2020 ERC-COG-2019 project; EU H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie project (GOLF MSCARISE),This work is supported by EU H2020 ERC-COG-2019 project (TRUST -864724) and EU H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie project (GOLF MSCARISE 777742).

Urban disaster as one of the climate change consequences is also experienced by global cities, deteriorating urban livability. This study aims to explore the change of urban livability in the process of urban disaster impact and adaptation under climate change with the case of China. Climate information is applied in livability assessment to inform urban adaptation to climate change. While exploring how climate change is going to affect livability, the assessment framework also suggested positive changes in the mode of production and lifestyle to mitigate climate impact and build livable, resilient, and cooler cities. Urban social-ecological-technological systems are dynamic and are constantly responding to climate pressures. A composite index was constructed based on the pressure-state-response model and three key urban functions including livelihood, ecological, and production function. The index was employed to evaluate the spatial pattern of urban livability in 290 prefectural-level cities in China. Results showed spatial heterogeneity of urban livability in China across geographical location, administrative and economic development hierarchies. There is also the unevenness of urban functions in Chinese cities, with production and livelihood in the domination of urban livability.

However, the well documented themes and recommendations continue to emerge with little evidence of effective climate change adaptation strategies being implemented. This is because while climate change adaptation strategies are not hard to develop, it is difficult to evaluate their effectiveness or, in some cases, even define effectiveness. Compounding this is the fact that implementing strategies that in theory, or in pilot studies, are potentially effective is complicated due to political, economic, legislative and science constraints and the difficulties associated with decision making under uncertainty. Here we focus on Australian rural communities and have found that a major barrier to implementation of effective adaptation strategies is the disconnect between the information that end-users need (or think they need) and the existing outcomes of climate change impacts and adaptation research. While previous research, and anecdotal evidence, qualitatively establishes that a 'gap' does exist, this study represents a preliminary attempt at quantifying the causes and magnitude of the disconnect: a necessary first step in addressing the challenge posed by this barrier to adaptation. The findings are relevant beyond Australia, beyond the agriculture sector, and beyond climate change science, and highlight the need for urgent work aimed at bridging the gap between scientists and decision makers (and other end-users).","[Kiem, Anthony S.; Austin, Emma K.] Univ Newcastle, Environm & Climate Change Res Grp, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Fac Sci & Informat Technol, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Kiem, AS (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Environm & Climate Change Res Grp, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Fac Sci & Informat Technol, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",anthony.kiem@newcastle.edu.au,"Kiem, Anthony/D-9307-2013","Kiem, Anthony/0000-0002-3994-6958",,,,,45,31,31,1,35,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0936-577X,1616-1572,,CLIM RES,Clim.

Funds are meant to be allocated not to any types of beneficial investments with or without climate change but to projects regarded as effective for climate change adaptation based on some metrics. But attempts at such project-specific evaluation of adaptation effects are few, in part because such assessments require an integration of various types of simulation analyses. Against this background, we conduct a case study of a Kenyan irrigation development project using a combination of downscaled climate data, runoff simulations, yield forecasting, and local socioeconomic projections to examine the effects of interventions specifically attributable to climate change adaptation, i.e., how much irrigation development can reduce the negative effects of climate change in the future. The results show that despite the uncertainties in precipitation trends, increased temperatures due to climate change have a general tendency to reduce rice yields, and that irrigation development will mitigate income impacts from the yield loss-for example, for the median scenario, the household income loss of 6% in 2050 due to climate change without irrigation development is flipped to become positive with the project. This means that the irrigation development project will likely be effective as a means for climate change adaptation.","[Narita, Daiju] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Narita, Daiju] JICA Ogata Res Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Narita, Daiju] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Sato, Ichiro] Japan Int Cooperat Agcy JICA, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Ogawada, Daikichi; Matsumura, Akiko] Nippon Koei Co Ltd, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan","University of Tokyo; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Nippon Koei Co., Ltd.","Narita, D (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Tokyo, Japan.;Narita, D (corresponding author), JICA Ogata Res Inst, Tokyo, Japan.;Narita, D (corresponding author), Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.",daiju.narita@global.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Sato, Ichiro/HGU-7251-2022; Narita, Daiju/G-7125-2016","Sato, Ichiro/0000-0001-7253-2178; Narita, Daiju/0000-0001-5695-9913","JICA; JICA Ogata Research Institute (JICA-RI); JSPS Kakenhi [17KT0066, 17K00677]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17K00677, 17KT0066] Funding Source: KAKEN","JICA; JICA Ogata Research Institute (JICA-RI); JSPS Kakenhi(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study is funded by JICA and the JICA Ogata Research Institute (JICA-RI), which also provided various logistical support.

However, the business and management field has repeatedly been criticized for its lack of engagement with climate change as a pressing issue, and adaptation to the physical impacts of climate change in particular. Our review of adaptation studies in the business and management field suggests that most firm and industry adaptation studies focus on how firms adjust to changing business conditions because of the emergence of new competitors, new products, and markets or because of changed political, economic, and legal conditions; they largely exclude firm adjustments to the changing dynamics of the natural environment. Studies on firm and industry adaptation to climate impacts specifically are beginning to emerge, but they are sparse. There is still little cross-disciplinary work integrating findings from the natural sciences into business thinking. We also find few considerations of the implications and consequences of climate change for firms and industries to date. This article provides an overview over the existing literature on firm adaptation to climate change, outlines research gaps, and suggests pathways for future research.

Green infrastructure aimed to intensify ecological processes in built-up areas and deliver vital ecosystem services is of a key significance for Russia, one of the most urbanized countries in the world. The article is dedicated to the issue of providing cities sustainability through creating a basic element of the urban green infrastructure-a public green network-by incorporating and linking a variety of already existing urban environmental components, both spatial and linear, such as natural areas, squares, parks, streets, boulevards, embankments and others. The territory of the case study is Krasnodar region located in the southwestern part of the North Caucasus, the warmest region of Russia characterized by highly varied urban areas. The authors propose the multiple criteria method for evaluating the existing GreenPS and creating a GreenPS framework for six cities located in Krasnodar region both on the southern seaward part and on the northern steppe part. This approach is focused on the sustainable development of the cities, adaptation to climate change and the prevention of local risks with respect to the preservation of ecosystem functions and cultural heritage. The methodology includes three stages: investigating and evaluating the present state of the existing urban GreenPS; defining sustainability potential; and the submission of master plan proposals for the improvement and further development and management of the GreenPS network implementing nature-based solutions. In addition, it follows seven main integral criteria, namely, Accessibility, Density, Sufficiency, Continuity, Diversity, Value and Clean and Sanitary, illustrated by ray diagrams. The results of the study show good potential for construction in Krasnodar region cities of an efficient GreenPS network integrating ecological and social city components. The flexibility of the method proposed makes it replicable for any other city aimed at creating a GreenPS network in sustainable, climate-change-adapted cities.","[Danilina, Nina; Tsurenkova, Ksenia; Berkovich, Vladislav] Natl Res Moscow State Univ Civil Engn, Urban Planning Dept, Yaroslavskoe Sh 26, Moscow 129337, Russia",Moscow State University of Civil Engineering,"Danilina, N (corresponding author), Natl Res Moscow State Univ Civil Engn, Urban Planning Dept, Yaroslavskoe Sh 26, Moscow 129337, Russia.",DanilinaNV@mgsu.ru; ksuxa.tsurenkova@mail.ru; vladislav.berkovich@gmail.com,"Danilina, Nina/AAE-7301-2020","Danilina, Nina/0000-0002-9465-6435",Ministry of Science and Higher Education [075-15-2021-686],"Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland)",FundingThis work was financially supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education (grant # 075-15-2021-686).

Joint knowledge production or coproduction of knowledge have become increasingly popular terms to describe the process of scientists, policy makers and actors from the civil society coming together to cooperate in the production, dissemination, and application of knowledge to solve wicked problems such as climate change. Networks are particularly suited to produce knowledge in a joint fashion. However, the process of joint knowledge production (JKP) in networks has rarely been examined. In this paper, we present a sketch of the adaptation network landscape and assess how joint knowledge production supports the development of solution-oriented knowledge in climate change adaptation networks. We conclude that the processes of JKP are diverse, complex, and highly dependent on the interests and roles of actors within the network. To keep such processes alive, signposts in form of analysis and intermediary products along the network lifetime should be positioned as means of stocktaking and monitoring for the future.","[Muccione, Veruska; Huggel, Christian] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bresch, David N.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bresch, David N.] Swiss Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, Zurich, Switzerland; [Jurt, Christine] Bern Univ Appl Sci, Sch Agr Forest & Food Sci HAFL, Bern, Switzerland; [Wallimann-Helmer, Ivo] Univ Fribourg, Dept Geosci, Fribourg, Switzerland; [Mehra, Meeta K.] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Int Studies, New Delhi, India; [Pabon Caicedo, Jose Daniel] Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Geog, Bogota, Colombia","University of Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Federal Office of Meteorology & Climatology (MeteoSwiss); University of Fribourg; Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi; Universidad Nacional de Colombia","Muccione, V (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich, Switzerland.",veruska.muccione@geo.uzh.ch,"Bresch, David N./D-5298-2018; Walliman-Helmer, Ivo/AAW-2319-2021","Bresch, David N./0000-0002-8431-4263; Walliman-Helmer, Ivo/0000-0002-0548-6340; Pabon-Caicedo, Jose Daniel/0000-0002-0012-1318",swissuniversities Development and Cooperation Network (SUDAC) programme; Executive Board of the University of Zurich; Faculty of Science of the University of Zurich,swissuniversities Development and Cooperation Network (SUDAC) programme; Executive Board of the University of Zurich; Faculty of Science of the University of Zurich,This work has been supported by a grant of the swissuniversities Development and Cooperation Network (SUDAC) programme.

Past studies on these interactions have focused on the information needs of decision-makers, but less is known about why and how climate researchers choose to engage with decision-makers. Understanding the experiences, beliefs and constraints on both sides of the 'knowledge-action gap' is critical for implementing robust climate adaptation strategies. This study thus examines the perspectives and experiences of researchers regarding practitioner engagement, drawing from an original survey of California's climate research community (N= 991) and supplemental interviews. Given a history of support for climate research and climate change adaptation, analysis of the California case is useful as a means of characterizing the relationship between climate research and practitioner engagement. We find that most scientists want to engage more with practitioners but are constrained by several factors, including resource limitations and the challenge of building relationships. Additionally, we find that the level of interest and frequency of engagement with stakeholders varies significantly across academic disciplines. We demonstrate that building capacity within research organizations and integrating stakeholder engagement in funding criteria and professional development can help foster relationship-building between scientists and decision-makers. The analysis suggests that the social structure of climate research warrants further examination of the ways that climate researchers relate to practitioners at present.","[Baker, Zeke] NOAA, Natl Weather Serv, Anchorage, AK 99513 USA; [Baker, Zeke] Univ Oklahoma, Cooperat Inst Mesoscale Meteorol Studies, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Baker, Zeke; Ekstrom, Julia A.; Meagher, Kelsey D.] Univ Calif Davis, Policy Inst Energy Environm & Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Ekstrom, Julia A.] Calif Dept Water Resources, Sacramento, CA USA; [Meagher, Kelsey D.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Preston, Benjamin L.] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA USA; [Bedsworth, Louise] Calif Strateg Growth Council, Sacramento, CA USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; RAND Corporation,"Baker, Z (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Weather Serv Alaska Reg, 222 West 7th Ave,Room 517, Anchorage, AK 99513 USA.",zeke.baker@noaa.gov,,"Meagher, Kelsey/0000-0002-5841-1721",US EPA [RD835194010],US EPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"The authors thank the survey and interview respondents for sharing their time and insights to make this study possible.

Adaptation strategies can increase farmers' resilience to climate change in agricultural production. Many studies have explored how farmers adapted to climate change on the underlying premise that they homogeneously have a complete knowledge about climate change adaptation strategies. However, the knowledge of smallholder farmers can be incomplete and heterogeneous particularly under climatic shocks. And the role of social network in farmers' adaptation decisions cannot be neglected. We specify social network into formal social tie (cooperative membership), and informal social tie (to local farmers and agricultural input retailers). This paper is the first attempt to examine the heterogeneous impact of social ties on farmers' adaptation decisions, and further assess the effect of adaptation strategies on land productivity under climate change using Augmented Inverse Probability Weights (AIPW) estimator, based on the primary data collected from banana farmers in China. The results show that 55 percent of banana farmers adopted adaptation strategies to mitigate the impact of climate change in farming practices. Out of eight coping strategies, diversifying crops, increasing chemical use, increasing irrigation and planting trees were prioritized measures used by banana farmers. Both formal and informal social ties of farmers exerted a significant impact on farmers' adaptation decisions. Participation in agricultural cooperatives and tie to agricultural input retailers increased farmers' uptake rate of adaptation strategies. In contrast, tie to local farmers hindered farmers from taking active actions to combat climate change. We also found that the adaptation strategies significantly increased the land productivity of banana farmers. Interestingly, the land productivity of adopters was more influenced by the formal social tie (cooperative membership); while the informal social tie (to agricultural input retailers) affected that of non-adopters. These findings highlight the importance of different social ties of smallholder farmers in designing policy package to increase their responses to climate change and improve land productivity in developing regions.","[Zhu, Yueji; Yang, Qi; Zhang, Cheng] Hainan Univ, Management Sch, Haikou, Hainan, Peoples R China",Hainan University,"Zhu, YJ (corresponding author), 58 Renmin Ave, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China.",zhuyueji@126.com,"Zhu, Yueji/GQP-0415-2022","Zhu, Yueji/0000-0002-5038-0246",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71863006]; Hainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [720RC581]; China Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA [CARS-31-14]; Research of the Youth Fund for Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education [20YJC790197],"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China; China Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA(Ministry of Oceans & Fisheries (MOF), Republic of Korea); Research of the Youth Fund for Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71863006), Hainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 720RC581), China Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA (No. CARS-31-14), and the Research of the Youth Fund for Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education (No. 20YJC790197).",,63,2,2,5,18,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

Its objective is to contribute to a better understanding of maladaptation at the policy level. The discourse analysis method is used to explain perceptions of climate variability in Tyumen Province and its impact on agriculture. The document analysis method is used to assess agricultural policy in Tyumen Province and its implications for producers' adaptation to climate change. The results suggest that although agricultural producers and policymakers are acutely aware both of climate variability and the resulting loss of agricultural output, provincial agricultural policy generally fails to encourage better adaptation by agricultural producers or to support their greater economic security. Instead, it primarily focuses on meeting food production targets and thus limits the producers' own independent moves towards adaptation. The phenomenon of maladaptation at the policy level is discussed in consideration of the general public's and the authorities' awareness of climate change and climate variability, and the role of science in shaping this awareness.

The article investigates how, conversely speaking, the residential buildings will be affected by climate change, and how to improve existing structures and support long-term decisions. Design/methodology/approach The climate dataset was created using the scenarios determined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and this was used in the study. Different building envelope and Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems scenarios have been developed and simulated. Then, the best scenario was determined with comparative results, and recommendations were developed. Findings The findings reveal that future temperature-increase will significantly impact buildings' cooling and heating energy use. As the outdoor air temperatures increase due to climate change, the heating loads of the buildings decrease, and the cooling loads increase significantly. While the heating energy consumption of the house was calculated at 170.85 kWh/m(2) in 2020, this value shall decrease significantly to 115.01 kWh/m(2) in 2080. On the other hand, the cooling energy doubled between 2020 and 2080 and reached 106.95 kWh/m(2) from 53.14 kWh/m(2) measured in 2020. Originality/value Single-family houses constitute a significant proportion of the building stock. An in-depth analysis of such a building type is necessary to cope with the devastating consequences of climate change. The study developed and scrutinised energy performance improvement scenarios to define the climate change adaptation process' impact and proper procedure. The study is trying to create a strategy to increase the climate resistance capabilities of buildings and fill the gaps in this regard.","[Tomrukcu, Gokce] Ozyegin Univ, Grad Sch Engn & Sci, Dept Architecture, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ashrafian, Touraj] Ozyegin Univ, Fac Architecture & Design, Dept Architecture, Istanbul, Turkey",Ozyegin University; Ozyegin University,"Tomrukcu, G (corresponding author), Ozyegin Univ, Grad Sch Engn & Sci, Dept Architecture, Istanbul, Turkey.",gokce.tomrukcu@ozu.edu.tr,"Ashrafian, Touraj/C-4873-2011","Ashrafian, Touraj/0000-0001-9243-7071; TOMRUKCU, GOKCE/0000-0003-2637-7896",,,,,36,0,0,1,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2398-4708,,,INT J BUILD PATHOL,Int.

Within the agricultural sector of many developing nations, farmers must make long-term decisions to adapt to climate change impacts in order to provide food security and sustainable livelihoods. However, deeper understanding of farmers' decision-making, as a key stakeholder group, is of vital importance in forming adaptive land use policy 'from the bottom-up'. This study investigates the psychosocial factors that influence farmers' adaptation intention in the critical case of Marvdasht County in Iran - a case that exemplifies agricultural stakeholder decision-making in arid and drought-prone regions. We present a conceptual combination-model grounded in Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), employing a correlational survey among 256 farmer-stakeholders. First, we discuss the relative value of the combined model to understanding adaptation intentions. Second, we find that the factors that represent the externalities of farmers' behaviour need to be more thoroughly integrated in to adaptation planning. Third, we find that farmers' adaptation intention is directly affected by maladaptation, and indirectly by economic disincentives, barriers to belief in anthropogenic climate change and broader risk perceptions.","[Ghanian, Mansour; Ghoochani, Omid M.; Dehghanpour, Mojtaba; Taqipour, Milad] Agr Sci & Nat Resources Univ Khuzestan, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Ahvaz, Iran; [Taheri, Fatemeh] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Ghent, Belgium; [Cotton, Matthew] Univ York, Dept Environm & Geog, York, N Yorkshire, England",Ghent University; University of York - UK,"Ghanian, M (corresponding author), Agr Sci & Nat Resources Univ Khuzestan, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Ahvaz, Iran.",m_ghanian@asnrukh.ac.ir,"Ghanian, Mansour/AAA-6106-2022; Ghanian, Mansour/V-1072-2018; Ghanian, Mansour/AAZ-2881-2020","Ghanian, Mansour/0000-0002-8428-1107; Cotton, Matthew/0000-0002-8877-4822; M.

For this study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with Dutch cultural heritage and environmental or climate change experts (n = 52) and participant observations across the Netherlands to explore the importance of cultural heritage benefits and their relation to climate change actions. We also explored the perceptions of cultural heritage management over time, including the influence of climate policy on heritage practice in the Netherlands. Our findings show that experts perceived a multiplicity of heritage benefits as important in supporting and informing present and future climate change actions. The most salient benefits were informational benefits where diverse cultural heritage is perceived as an important source of knowledge about past societal, economic and environmental developments and changes. Further, heritage management was perceived as constantly changing over time, reflecting the transformative nature of diverse heritage types. Experts agreed that climate policy has already influenced cultural heritage practice in the Netherlands. Lastly, the interrelationships between heritage benefits and management were identified and characterised. This study informs both cultural heritage and climate change research agendas and helps leverage diverse cultural heritage into climate change adaptation and mitigation policies.","[Fatoric, Sandra] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands; [Egberts, Linde] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Humanities, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Fatoric, S (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands.",s.fatoric@tudelft.nl; l.r.egberts@vu.nl,,"Fatoric, Sandra/0000-0002-3712-0749; Egberts, Linde/0000-0002-0076-1569",European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [707404],European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"The research presented in this paper was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 707404.

Data for this study was collected through surveys, interviews, and focus group discussions to gather indigenous knowledge on native crop varieties and animal breeds, weather forecasting, and the timing and location of cultivation practices. In so doing, this study documents unique examples of how indigenous knowledge is being used alone and blended with scientific knowledge to make accurate decisions and help local communities adapt to climate change. The case of the Yao people in northern Vietnam supports the argument that if indigenous knowledge were better integrated into adaptation planning and policies, its conservation and application would enhance resiliency to climate change in indigenous communities and beyond.","[Ho Ngoc Son; Dong Thi Linh Chi; Kingsbury, Aaron] Thai Nguyen Univ Agr & Forestry, Agr & Forestry Res & Dev Ctr Mt Reg ADC, Thai Nguyen City, Vietnam; [Kingsbury, Aaron] Maine Maritime Acad, 1 Pleasant St, Castine, ME USA",Thai Nguyen University,"Son, HN (corresponding author), Thai Nguyen Univ Agr & Forestry, Agr & Forestry Res & Dev Ctr Mt Reg ADC, Thai Nguyen City, Vietnam.",son.ho@adc.org.vn,"Son, Ho Ngoc/AHD-9608-2022","Son, Ho Ngoc/0000-0002-5270-5577","International Foundation for Science, Stockholm, Sweden [J-1-S-4868-2]; Asia Pacific Network for Global Change Research [CBA 2017-01MY-Ho]","International Foundation for Science, Stockholm, Sweden(International Foundation for Science); Asia Pacific Network for Global Change Research","This work was conducted as part of the research program of the Agriculture and Forestry Research & Development Centre for Mountainous Region (ADC) at Thai Nguyen University of Agriculture and Forestry.

However, water is a scarce resource that needs efficient utilization. This study explored (1) farmers' perceptions about the roles of irrigation in climate change adaptation and (2) determinants of the choices to selected WUE-improving soil and water management practices in southern Ethiopia. A multistage sampling technique was used to survey 373 households. The results indicated that the majority of surveyed households were male-headed: 90.6%, above 40 years old: 56.8%, and uneducated: 73.5%. They perceived that irrigation improved their net income (INCOM): 88%, acted as insurance against decreased rainfall (IADR): 44.8%, and insurance against increased temperature (IAIT): 70%; though the water was not available in all dry seasons: 55%. The choice to tightly close water-diversion points after use is significantly positively (p< .05) affected by education level (EDUC) and perceptions about irrigation water as IADR and IAIT. However, the farmers' perceptions about INCOM significantly negatively affected their choice to not irrigate at peak sunshine hours. The choice of mulching is significantly positively affected by the perception of INCOM and IAIT. Similarly. the choice of using compost is significantly positively affected by EDUC and their perceptions of IADR and IAIT, and significantly negatively affected by INCOM. The choice of not practicing conventional tillage is strongly negatively affected by the farmers' perceptions about equitable water distribution (EWD) and INCOM. Therefore. it can be concluded that the farmers' understanding of the roles of irrigation in climate change adaptation is good but their understanding of WUE-improving practices is poor due to poor water distribution systems and low education levels. So, improving water distribution systems and farmers' awareness about WUE-improving practices are suggested to the study area and other countries under related conditions.","[Chinasho, Alefu; Bedadi, Bobe; Lemma, Tesfaye] Haramaya Univ, Haramaya, Ethiopia; [Chinasho, Alefu] Wolaita Sodo Univ, Wolaita Sodo, Ethiopia; [Tana, Tamado] Univ Eswatini, Kwaluseni, Eswatini; [Hordofa, Tilahun] Melkasa Res Ctr, Adama, Ethiopia; [Elias, Bisrat] Arba Minch Univ, Arba Minch, Ethiopia",Haramaya University; Arba Minch University,"Chinasho, A (corresponding author), Haramaya Univ, Africa Ctr Excellence Climate SABC, POB 138, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia.",chinalefu11@gmail.com,"Tefera, Tesfaye Lemma/HGB-0540-2022","Chinasho, Alefu/0000-0003-2325-4284","Africa Center of Excellence for Climate Smart Agriculture and Biodiversity Conservation; Haramaya University (World Bank); Wolaita Sodo University, Ethiopia","Africa Center of Excellence for Climate Smart Agriculture and Biodiversity Conservation; Haramaya University (World Bank); Wolaita Sodo University, Ethiopia","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This manuscript is part of a Ph.D. dissertation work of a corresponding author supervised by the co-authors and financially supported by Africa Center of Excellence for Climate Smart Agriculture and Biodiversity Conservation, Haramaya University (World Bank), and Wolaita Sodo University, Ethiopia.",,79,1,1,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1178-6221,,,AIR SOIL WATER RES,Air Soil Water Res.,APR,2022,15,,,,,,,,1.17862212210925E+016,10.1177/11786221221092454,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/11786221221092454,,,14,Environmental Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0M8XV,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000782432600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This volume of Progress in Planning seeks to contribute to the widening debate about how the transformation of cities to respond to the changing climate is being understood, managed and achieved. We focus particularly on spatial planning, and building the capacity of this key mechanism for responding to the adaptation imperative in urban areas. The core focus is the outcomes of a collaborative research project, EcoCities, undertaken at the University of Manchester's School of Environment and Development. EcoCities drew upon inter-disciplinary research on climate science, environmental planning and urban design working within a socio-technical framework to investigate climate change hazards, vulnerabilities and adaptation responses in the conurbation of Greater Manchester, UK. Emerging transferable learning with potential relevance for adaptation planning in other cities and urban areas is drawn out to inform this rapidly emerging international agenda. Approaches to build adaptive capacity challenge traditional approaches to environmental and spatial planning, and the role of researchers in this process, raising questions over whether appropriate governance structures are in place to develop effective responses. The cross-cutting nature of the adaptation agenda exposes the silo based approaches that drive many organisations. The development of a collaborative, sociotechnical agenda is vital if we are to meet the climate change adaptation challenge in cities. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Based on discussions on similarities and differences between CCA and DRR concerning their spatial-temporal scales, main focuses, preferred research approaches and methodologies, etc., this paper tentatively put forward an analytical framework of 6W for linking DRR with CCA. This framework presented preliminary answers to a series of fundamental questions, such as What is adaptation with respect to disaster risk? Why adaptation is needed? Who adapt to what? How to adapt? What are the possible principles to assess the adaptation effect? To bridge the research gaps between CCA and DRR, it is imperative to associate the adaptation actions with both near-term disaster risk and long-term climate change and formulate adaptation strategies at various spatial-temporal scales by embracing uncertainty in a changing climate.","[Lei, Yongdeng; Wang, Jing'ai] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Lei, Yongdeng; Wang, Jing'ai] Beijing Normal Univ, Key Lab Reg Geog, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Lei, Yongdeng; Wang, Jing'ai] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University,"Wang, J (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",leiyongdeng568@gmail.com; jwang@bnu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41171402]; State Key Scientific Program of China (973 Project) [2012CB955403],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Scientific Program of China (973 Project),This study was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41171402) and the State Key Scientific Program of China (973 Project) (No. 2012CB955403).

Social representations theory suggests how individuals and society make sense of the unfamiliar and hence how the resultant social representations (SRs) cognitively, emotionally, and actively orient people and enable communication. SRs are social constructions that emerge through individual and collective engagement with media and with everyday conversations among people. Recent developments in text analysis techniques, and in particular topic modeling, provide a potentially powerful analytical method to examine the structure and content of SRs using large samples of narrative or text. In this paper I describe the methods and results of applying topic modeling to 660 micronarratives collected from Australian academics/researchers, government employees, and members of the public in 2010-2011. The narrative fragments focused on adaptation to climate change (CC) and hence provide an example of Australian society making sense of an emerging and conflict ridden phenomena. The results of the topic modeling reflect elements of SRs of adaptation to CC that are consistent with findings in the literature as well as being reasonably robust predictors of classes of action in response to CC. Bayesian Network (BN) modeling was used to identify relationships among the topics (SR elements) and in particular to identify relationships among topics, sentiment, and action. Finally the resulting model and topic modeling results are used to highlight differences in the salience of SR elements among social groups. The approach of linking topic modeling and BN modeling offers a new and encouraging approach to analysis for ongoing research on SRs.","[Lynam, Timothy] Reflecting Soc, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Lynam, Timothy] James Cook Univ, Dept Anthropol, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Lynam, Timothy] CSIRO, Kawana, Qld, Australia",James Cook University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Lynam, T (corresponding author), Reflecting Soc, Townsville, Qld, Australia.;Lynam, T (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Dept Anthropol, Townsville, Qld, Australia.;Lynam, T (corresponding author), CSIRO, Kawana, Qld, Australia.",,,,Reflecting Society; James Cook University,Reflecting Society; James Cook University,"The support and assistance of staff and students from the University of the Sunshine Coast in relation to collecting data at the NCCARF conference is gratefully acknowledged.

Despite the interest, the overall amount of international adaptation finance that has reached local recipients remains low. What makes internationally-financed climate change adaptation projects focus on investment at the community level is particularly poorly understood. This study systematically assesses conditions that influence the focus on vulnerable local communities in internationally-financed adaptation projects. Using the Adaptation Fund (AF) under the Kyoto Protocol as the case study, we apply fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to analyze 30 AF projects to identify specific configurations of conditions that lead to a stronger or weaker community focus in project design. We find that the absence of high exposure to projected future climate risks is a necessary condition for a weaker community focus in AF projects. Three configurations of sufficient conditions are identified that lead to a stronger community focus. They involve the contextual factors of projected future climate risks, civil society governance, and access modality to AF financing. In particular, AF projects with a stronger community focus are stimulated by the sole presence of higher exposure to projected future climate risks in a group of countries, and by the complementary roles of civil society governance and the access modality to the AF in others.

Design/methodology/approach - The CCVRM is used to examine the community-based EWS being implemented in the municipalities of Infanta and General Nakar in Quezon Province, Philippines. The levels of vulnerabilities and risks of the two localities are assessed through qualitative analysis using the CCVRM as framework. The model is also used to analyze the effects of the EWS in addressing the localities' vulnerabilities and risks. Findings - Technological and institutional vulnerabilities of the Infanta and General Nakar systems have lessened when the EWS project was implemented. Technological and institutional vulnerabilities have direct correlations with mortality risk; thus, when the levels of the former decrease, so does the latter. Although the reduced technological and institutional vulnerabilities have an effect on the other type of risks present in the municipalities, the effects were not as significant as that of with mortality risk. Research limitations/implications - Due to limited time and resources, only one adaptation program is analyzed, specifically, the community-based EWS being implemented in the municipalities of Infanta and General Nakar, Philippines. An integrated analysis of different measures is not done. Although investigating a multi-adaptation program is possible, this would require more time and resources to implement. Likewise, only a simple evaluation based on model definitions is conducted, instead of a more extensive risk and vulnerability assessment. Originality/value - The CCVRM acts as an analytical guide in understanding the effects of climate change adaptive measures. Accordingly, this paper investigates the effects of an implemented adaptive measure. The study also shows how the CCVRM can be used to analyze planned measures and identify the types of risks and vulnerabilities that this type of adaptive measure can influence.","Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Cuevas, S (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",s.cuevas@uq.edu.au,,,,,,,25,3,3,0,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

We identified five Med-cities with a climate change adaptation plan: Adelaide, Barcelona, Cape Town, Los Angeles and Santiago. Beyond their similar Med-climate features (although Santiago's are slightly different), the cities have different socio-economic characteristics in various aspects. We analyzed each plan according to how it addresses climate change-related drivers of health impacts among city dwellers. For each driver, we identified the types of policy adaptation tools that address it in the urban climate adaptation plans. The surveyed cities address most of the fundamental climate change-related drivers of risks to human health, including rising temperatures, flooding and drought, but the policy measures to reduce negative impacts vary across cities. We suggest recommendations for Med-cities in various aspects, depending on their local needs and vulnerability challenges: assessment of health risks, extreme events management and long-term adaptation, among others.","[Paz, Shlomit] Univ Haifa, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, IL-3498838 Haifa, Israel; [Negev, Maya; Green, Manfred S.] Univ Haifa, Sch Publ Hlth, IL-3498838 Haifa, Israel; [Clermont, Alexandra] Arava Inst Environm Studies, IL-88840 Kibbutz Ketura, DN Hevel Eilot, Israel",University of Haifa; University of Haifa,"Paz, S (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, IL-3498838 Haifa, Israel.",shlomit@geo.haifa.ac.il; maya.negev@gmail.com; alexclermont@gmail.com; manfred.s.green@gmail.com,"Negev, Maya/AAQ-4703-2020","Negev, Maya/0000-0002-5523-3210; Green, Manfred S./0000-0002-9753-5612",,,,,56,23,24,9,54,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The city of Fredericton, New Brunswick has a long history of river and overland flooding; however, more recent changes in local weather patterns have led to an increase in flood risk in the area. For more than a decade, decision-makers in Fredericton have worked to mainstream adaptation action within municipal policy in order to address the growing flood risk. Through anticipatory spatial planning and incremental infrastructure upgrades, the city aim's to proactively mitigate the impacts of climate change on day-to-day life. Framed through evolutionary governance, this article investigates the relationships between actors and institutions, as well as power and knowledge in order to uncover long-standing path dependencies that hinder comprehensive climate change adaptation action. While Fredericton can be considered a success story in many ways, this research reveals flawed multi-level governance structures and economic development goals as major barriers to effective adaptation in practice.

However empirical evidence has revealed that a small number of farmers adopt climate change adaptation technologies to build resilience to the shocks meted out to them by climate change. In this paper, using data from Ghana, we employ propensity score matching to control for selection bias and to analyse adoption of adaptation technologies, its determinants as well as impact on cocoa productivity and incomes. The results showed that most cocoa farmers do not adopt climate change adaptation technologies and for those who adopt some technologies, diversification of income sources was the major innovation. Also, eight factors including gender, age of respondent, involvement in other economic activities, farm size, membership of a farmer association, access to extension service, access to credit as well as annual income from cocoa production were found to significantly influence adoption of climate change adaptation technologies. Finally, cocoa farmers who adopted climate change adaptation technologies recorded significantly higher farm productivities and incomes vis-a-vis non adopters. To build resilience, cocoa farmers are encouraged to join farmer based organizations and extension officers should be supported to be able to reach out to farmers to educate them on climate change resilience technologies.","[Wongnaa, Camillus Abawiera] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Agr Econ Agribusiness & Extens, Private Mail Bag,Univ PO, Kumasi, Ghana; [Babu, Suresh] Int Food Policy Res Inst, 1201 Eye St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Wongnaa, CA (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Agr Econ Agribusiness & Extens, Private Mail Bag,Univ PO, Kumasi, Ghana.",wongnaaa@yahoo.com,,,,,,,60,17,17,2,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-791X,1879-3274,,TECHNOL SOC,Technol.

In this study, we offer cost estimates of public R&D-led adaptation to climate change grounded in an explicit framework relating the flow of annual R&D expenditures to building knowledge capital and thereby raising productivity in agriculture. Our research uses a comprehensive collection of historical public agricultural R&D expenditure and a literature review of elasticity estimates linking knowledge stocks to agricultural productivity growth for key world regions. Given climate-driven crop yield projections generated from extreme combinations of crop and global circulation models, we find that offsetting crop yield losses projected by climate and crop models over 2006-2050 would require increased R&D adaptation investments of between $187 billion and $1,384 billion (in 2005 $PPP) if we invest between 2020 and 2040. This is 16-118% higher than global R&D investment if present spending trends continue. Although these costs are significant, worldwide R&D-led climate adaptation could offer favorable economic returns. Moreover, R&D-led adaptation could deliver gains in food security and environmental sustainability by mitigating food price increases and slowing cropland expansion.","[Baldos, Uris Lantz C.; Hertel, Thomas W.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 610 Purdue Mall, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Fuglie, Keith O.] US Agcy Int Dev, Bur Resilience & Food Secur, Washington, DC 20523 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; United States Agency for International Development (USAID),"Baldos, ULC (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 610 Purdue Mall, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",ubaldos@purdue.edu,,"Fuglie, Keith/0000-0002-7601-0542","US Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service [58-6000-3-0037]","US Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","US Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, Grant/Award Number: 58-6000-3-0037",,49,18,19,4,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

They are also vulnerable to extreme weather events and sea level rise driven by climate change. Choosing the timing and scale of adaptation measures is challenging due to uncertainty about the rate of climate change, the frequency of disasters, and the irreversibility of investment in physical infrastructure. In addition to adaptation to climate change, ports must invest in throughput capacity to accommodate rising traffic volumes, reduce congestion, and maintain their long-term competitiveness. Ports also face uncertainty about shipping demand, which fluctuates with the business cycle, trade relations between countries, and other events. With this as background, we investigate the optimal timing and amount of port protection and capacity investments, as well as port charges, given uncertainty about climate-change-related threats and demand. The port gains better information over time, and thus has an option value to waiting. We show that the port charge is a decreasing function of capacity and an increasing function of protection. Capacity and protection are supermodular: a higher capacity warrants more protection, and better protection justifies higher capacity. If the disaster frequency rises, the port reduces its capacity and traffic volume but may increase or decrease protection investment. It prefers to postpone capacity investment if the disaster frequency can fall, but prefers to invest in advance if the climate is likely to get worse. It prefers to postpone protection investment if the disaster frequency changes a lot, or if the disaster frequency is currently low. The port also holds back on capacity and protection if future demand is highly uncertain. The results are largely the same for a landlord port, a service port, and a fully privatized port.","[Xia, Wenyi] HEC Montreal, Dept Logist & Operat Management, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada; [Lindsey, Robin] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; University of British Columbia,"Xia, WY (corresponding author), HEC Montreal, Dept Logist & Operat Management, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",wenyi.xia@hec.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [435-2014-2050]; Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Societe et culture [2022-NP-297108],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Societe et culture,"Financial support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (Grant 435-2014-2050) and Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Societe et culture (Grant 2022-NP-297108) are gratefully acknowledged.

However, during the past decade the need to adapt to a changing climate has attracted increasing attention. This paper summarises a case study on the future vulnerability to climate change of the Swedish railway transport system and its adaptive capacity. The combination of a long time horizon in planning and an expected increasing demand for rail traffic raises many questions regarding how adaptation to climate change can be accounted for in future planning, design and management of railways. The case study was essentially based on interviews with key personnel within the Swedish Rail Administration. Views on vulnerability and adaptation to climate change were documented, and the need for improved methods to assess the vulnerability and adaptive capacity related to climate change for the Swedish railways was addressed. The conclusions of the paper are addressed to the European railway context at large. Firstly, systematic mapping of current climate vulnerabilities and their consequences is important in order to guide the implementation of adaptation measures. Secondly, climate change should be considered in the early stages of planning and included in risk and vulnerability assessments. In assessing future conditions with the aim of prioritising adaptation measures, current methodologies should be complemented with more future-orientated tools. When designing adaptation measures, the effects of potential goal conflicts should also be assessed, in order to avoid the implementation of counter-productive measures. The possibility of creating synergies with climate mitigation goals and other environmental goals should also be investigated.","[Lindgren, Johan; Carlsson-Kanyama, Annika] Swedish Def Res Agcy, FOI, SE-16490 Stockholm, Sweden; [Jonsson, Daniel K.] Swedish Def Res Agcy, FOI, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Jonsson, Daniel K.] Royal Inst Technol, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",FOI - Swedish Defence Research Agency; Saab Group; FOI - Swedish Defence Research Agency; Saab Group; Royal Institute of Technology,"Lindgren, J (corresponding author), Swedish Def Res Agcy, FOI, SE-16490 Stockholm, Sweden.",johan.lindgren@foi.se; daniel.jonsson@foi.se; annika.carlsson-kanyama@foi.se,,,,,,,58,37,37,1,19,EDITORIAL BOARD EJTIR,JAFFALAAN 5,"SECTION TRANSPORT POLICY-TLO, JAFFALAAN 5, JAFFALAAN 5, 2628 BX, NETHERLANDS",1567-7133,1567-7141,,EUR J TRANSP INFRAST,Eur.

As research has largely focused on public sector adaptation, the mainstreaming of adaptation into private sector projects remains poorly understood. The aims of this study are twofold. First, we examine what drives private developers and investors to mainstream adaptation into large-scale urban development projects. Second, we explore what policy instruments municipalities can employ to stimulate private sector mainstreaming. Our theoretical lens combines insights from the literature on mainstreaming, sustainable building drivers and policy instruments. These concepts are used to guide our analysis of four urban development projects and an interview study in the Netherlands, a densely populated delta country which is rather vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Our results show that private developers and investors seldom explicitly include adaptation measures into their development projects. An important impediment is the perceived absence of direct monetary benefits. If adaptation measures are implemented, they are often realized as a side-effect of creating a high-quality living environment or because private actors expect other professional benefits, such as corporate image enhancement or development of know-how. To stimulate private sector mainstreaming, Dutch municipalities already use a mix of policy instruments that might be a source of inspiration for other countries. Yet, especially the way in which enforcement and incentives are applied is not always effective. Key policy insights Despite the private sector's growing awareness about the need for and importance of climate change adaptation in the Netherlands, adaptation is still seldom explicitly included in large-scale urban development projects. Municipalities should invest in policy instruments that target consumers. Communication, education and incentives can be used to raise consumer awareness and consequently demand for climate-adaptive properties. Municipalities should collaborate with the private sector to develop clear, uniform and feasible adaptation requirements. Municipalities should actively participate in urban development projects, i.e. co-developing with the private sector. This way, private sector drivers and policy instruments can strengthen each other to pave the way for future-proof and climate-resilient urban environments.","[ten Brinke, Niek; Vinke-de Kruijf, Joanne; Volker, Leentje] Univ Twente, Fac Engn Technol, Dept Civil Engn & Management, Enschede, Netherlands; [Prins, Nora] APPM Management Consultants, Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of Twente,"ten Brinke, N (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Fac Engn Technol, Dept Civil Engn & Management, Enschede, Netherlands.",n.s.tenbrinke@alumnus.utwente.nl,,"Volker, Leentje/0000-0003-2766-3763",,,,,51,0,0,2,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Though adherents of decentralization argue that local governments are more likely to conceive and implement proadaptation-related interventions, evidence from Ghana provides fascinating lessons. This paper shows that local governments' ability to mainstream adaptation-related actions into local governance is constricted by taxonomy of local political economy issues and the science-heaviness of climate change. It concludes that local government are unlikely to be a fulcrum of adaptation governance as touted if reasonable efforts are not made at strengthening and broadening its resource basket.","[Musah-Surugu, Issah Justice; Ahenkan, Albert; Bawole, Justcie Nyigmah] Univ Ghana, Dept Publ Adm & Hlth Serv Management, Business Sch, Accra, Ghana",University of Ghana,"Musah-Surugu, IJ (corresponding author), Univ Ghana, Dept Publ Adm & Hlth Serv Management, Business Sch, Accra, Ghana.",musah123@gmail.com,,,,,,,67,6,6,2,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Due to the impacts of climate change on precipitation patterns such as rise in rainfall intensity, reduction in its temporal spread, and a marked decline in winter rain, coupled with other anthropogenic causes, the problem of dying springs is being increasingly felt across this region. This study was taken up in the Sikkim Himalaya, which has received limited attention despite being a part of the Eastern Himalaya global biodiversity hot spot. The objective of this study was to understand the basic characteristics of the springs and to demonstrate methods for reviving them. We found the rural landscape dotted by a network of microsprings occurring largely in farmers' fields, with an average dependency of 27 (630) households per spring. The spring discharge generally showed an annual periodic rhythm suggesting a strong response to rainfall. The mean discharge of the springs was found to peak at 51 L/min during the postmonsoon months (September-November) and then diminish to 8 L/min during spring (March-May). The lean period (March-May) discharge is perceived to have declined by nearly 50% in drought-prone areas and by 35% in other areas over the last decade. The springshed development approach to revive 5 springs using rainwater harvesting and geohydrology techniques showed encouraging results, with the lean period discharge increasing substantially from 4.4 to 14.4 L/min in 2010-2011. The major challenges faced in springshed development were the following: identifying recharge areas accurately, developing local capacity, incentivizing rainwater harvesting in farmers' fields, and sourcing public financing. We recommend further action research studies to revive springs to advance the outcomes of this pilot study and mainstreaming of springshed development in watershed development, rural water supply, and climate change adaptation programs, especially in the Himalayan region.","[Tambe, Sandeep; Kharel, Ghanashyam; Ganeriwala, Anil K.] Gram Vikas Bhawan, Govt Sikkim, Dept Rural Management & Dev, Gangtok 737101, Sikkim, India; [Kulkarni, Himanshu; Mahamuni, Kaustubh] Lenyadri Soc, Adv Ctr Water Resources Dev & Management, Pune 411021, Maharashtra, India",,"Tambe, S (corresponding author), Gram Vikas Bhawan, Govt Sikkim, Dept Rural Management & Dev, Gangtok 737101, Sikkim, India.",sandeep_tambe@yahoo.com,"Tambe, Sandeep/AAL-5404-2020",,"WWF-India; People's Science Institute, Dehradun; Mountain Institute-India; State Institute of Rural Development; Rural Management and Development Department, Government of Sikkim; Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India","WWF-India; People's Science Institute, Dehradun; Mountain Institute-India; State Institute of Rural Development; Rural Management and Development Department, Government of Sikkim; Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India","We gratefully acknowledge the support received from WWF-India, People's Science Institute, Dehradun, The Mountain Institute-India, State Institute of Rural Development, Rural Management and Development Department, Government of Sikkim, and funding support from MGNREGA-National flagship programme of the Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India.

Research in fields such as political ecology and environmental justice emphasizes the importance of policy-making addressing and responding to climate injustices. It, moreover, stresses that democratic engagement is imperative, since no universal agreement on the meaning of justice exists. Democratic engagement on climate (in)justice is, however, hampered by the predominance of technocratic policy frames. Considering this, knowledge of ways to promote democratic engagement is called for. This study develops such knowledge related to policy-making for climate change adaptation and resilience at the local level, in developed country contexts. Specifically, it draws on the what's the problem represented to be? approach to conceptualize different styles of democratic engagement and examine the possibilities and limitations of each. From the data, comprised of previous research, representations of three styles of democratic engagement are identified and analyzed: (1) closure-oriented engagement centered on changing behaviors, (2) closure-oriented engagement centered on changing the systemic production of unjust practices, and (3) disruptive engagement centered on changing the systemic production of unjust practices. The contributions of this study are relevant to researchers, policymakers, activists and others interested in how to promote a democratization of climate policy-making.","[Olsson, David] Karlstad Univ, Dept Polit Hist Religious & Cultural Studies, Polit Sci, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden",Karlstad University,"Olsson, D (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Dept Polit Hist Religious & Cultural Studies, Polit Sci, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.",david.olsson@kau.se,,"Olsson, David/0000-0003-0745-2133",Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency through the project Societal Resilience in Sweden [217-34],Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency through the project Societal Resilience in Sweden,"FundingThis research was funded by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency through the project Societal Resilience in Sweden, award number 217-34.",,84,0,0,4,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2022,14,3,,,,,,,1433,10.3390/su14031433,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14031433,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZG2DP,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000760071900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We compared their climate change risk perceptions, socio-cultural influences, information sources, self-efficacy, barriers and incentives to adaptation, and management strategies. Small woodlot owners have much less knowledge of adaptation strategies, and greater perceived need for financial incentives, while forest professionals have higher social norms and more interest in market-based incentives. We found that both groups perceived climate change as a strong influencer on forest ecosystems, and that complexity of information was a key barrier to effective adaptation. The similarities that transcend forestry groups highlight several key perceptions of climate change that unify those working in diverse roles and positions. Implications for increasing implementation include framing communication messages to connect with specific audiences, such as discussing climate change in terms of forest health and wildlife concerns.","[Soucy, Alyssa; De Urioste-Stone, Sandra; Rahimzadeh-Bajgiran, Parinaz; Weiskittel, Aaron] Univ Maine, Sch Forest Resources, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Weiskittel, Aaron] Univ Maine, Ctr Res Sustainable Forests, Orono, ME USA; [McGreavy, Bridie] Univ Maine, Dept Commun & Journalism, Orono, ME USA",University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Soucy, A (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Sch Forest Resources, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",alyssa.r.soucy@maine.edu,"Weiskittel, Aaron/H-3688-2019","Weiskittel, Aaron/0000-0003-2534-4478; Soucy, Alyssa/0000-0001-6029-6382; McGreavy, Bridie/0000-0002-2477-2609","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, McIntire Stennis through the Maine Agricultural & Forest Experiment Station [ME0-41504]; AFRI Agriculture and Natural Resources Science for Climate Variability and Change (AFRI ANRCVC) Challenge Area Program [2018-69002-27933]; US Forest Service, State and Private Forestry [17-DG-11420004-144]; AVANGRID Foundation","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, McIntire Stennis through the Maine Agricultural & Forest Experiment Station; AFRI Agriculture and Natural Resources Science for Climate Variability and Change (AFRI ANRCVC) Challenge Area Program; US Forest Service, State and Private Forestry; AVANGRID Foundation","This work was supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, McIntire Stennis through the Maine Agricultural & Forest Experiment Station under project number ME0-41504; AFRI Agriculture and Natural Resources Science for Climate Variability and Change (AFRI ANRCVC) Challenge Area Program under Grant number 2018-69002-27933; US Forest Service, State and Private Forestry under Grant number 17-DG-11420004-144; and the AVANGRID Foundation.",,108,3,3,4,8,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2666-7193,,TREES FOREST PEOPLE,Trees For.

Coastal communities are subject to a wide range of stressors related to climate change, including biological resource decline and natural hazards. Small historically natural-resource-dependent communities are particularly vulnerable because of their close reliance on ecosystem goods and services that are likely to be affected by climate change (e.g., fisheries, forests) and their limited access to outside technical and financial resources needed for adaptation. Exogenous adaptation policies, while helpful for fostering new behavioral adjustments to address resource decline and natural hazards, can in some cases exacerbate socioeconomic disruption, further burdening communities already struggling to adapt. This paper presents an investigation of how six historically natural-resource-dependent coastal communities in Oregon, USA, have experienced and responded to external stressors and how adaptation in these communities has been shaped by interactions between past and present practices, processes, and vulnerabilities. Despite climate-related impacts identified by the scientific community, climate change was not salient in the community members' reports of stressors and impacts, and thus was not a trigger of adaptation. Rather, communities were responding to stressors associated with decades of declines in natural resource industries, an economic recession, restrictive natural resource management and land use policies, demographic change, and natural hazards. These findings confirm other research findings that chronic everyday problems, including those related to the maintenance of livelihoods, or consequences of inadequate livelihoods, often eclipse potentially disastrous threats in the minds of rural community members, thereby influencing adaptation strategies. In some cases communities do not prioritize such threats because people have come to accept living with them, or they feel powerless and unable to change the circumstances of daily life. The findings improve understanding of adaptation in natural-resource based coastal communities in the USA and support the need for policy makers and planners to integrate climate change adaptation into livelihood improvement strategies.

The relationship between value chain network attributes (i.e. connectivity and an actor's centrality) and indicators of value chain resilience (e.g. information sharing, flexibility and redundancy) is investigated through the analysis of qualitative data derived from field interviews and from the quantitative assessment of network metrics characterising information, financial and material flows of three agricultural value chains in Jamaica. The study illustrates how network analysis offers a systematic approach for understanding value chain resilience and the adaptive capacity of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and supports strategy development in business value chains. The study concludes that mixed-methods networked approaches provide valid methods for exploring a relational understanding of climate resilience in value chains, opening up new research opportunities for scholars interested in private sector climate adaptation.","[Canevari-Luzardo, Laura M.] King's Coll London, Geography Dept, London, England",University of London; King's College London,"Canevari-Luzardo, LM (corresponding author), King's Coll London, Geography Dept, London, England.",laura.canevari@kcl.ac.uk,,"Canevari-Luzardo, Laura M./0000-0001-6570-2669",,,,,69,3,3,4,19,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

The selection and formulation of research questions reflects a judgement on the part of the authors. The questions are broadly defined to allow elaboration, challenges, re-framings and add-ons, as we may have neglected issues outside our frame of focus: how community-led adaptation in vulnerable countries can be supported through the generation, dissemination and use of research. For convenience, the research agenda is structured around three overarching issues: (1) the sources, nature and dynamics of vulnerability, (2) the costs and benefits of adaptation, and (3) integration of climate change adaptation into disaster risk reduction and development.

Not only has the discussion focused on the causes of this issue, but many recommendations for enhancing the use of information and knowledge have also been made. The authors first frame the knowledge challenges and, second, introduce a systematic means to identify the factors hindering the use of information and knowledge. The approach proposed allows determining core barriers in the co-production, exchange, and use of knowledge. Subsequently, we illustrate where further advancement is needed in the field of knowledge development, means of transmission and use for disaster risk reduction. We suggest a method that analyses cases considering the success or failure of information flows from and to different stakeholder groups. The aim is to identify causes for knowledge fragmentation at different phases in the disaster management continuum, and, subsequently, to strengthen both individual and institutional learning, as well as to determine social and Functional changes required to address pressing issues of disaster risk reduction, including climate change adaptation, in a competent manner.

Here we present a quantitative framework inspired by the greenhouse gas stabilization wedges of Pacala and Socolow. In our proposed framework, the damage avoided by each adaptation activity creates an 'adaptation wedge' relative to the loss that would occur without that adaptation activity. We use premium winegrape suitability in the western United States as an illustrative case study, focusing on the near-term period that covers the years 2000-39. We find that the projected warming over this period results in the loss of suitable winegrape area throughout much of California, including most counties in the high-value North Coast and Central Coast regions. However, in quantifying adaptation wedges for individual high-value counties, we find that a large adaptation wedge can be captured by increasing the severe heat tolerance, including elimination of the 50% loss projected by the end of the 2030-9 period in the North Coast region, and reduction of the projected loss in the Central Coast region from 30% to less than 15%. Increased severe heat tolerance can capture an even larger adaptation wedge in the Pacific Northwest, including conversion of a projected loss of more than 30% in the Columbia Valley region of Washington to a projected gain of more than 150%. We also find that warming projected over the near-term decades has the potential to alter the quality of winegrapes produced in the western US, and we discuss potential actions that could create adaptation wedges given these potential changes in quality.

Real options analysis (ROA) is a robust decision-making tool that allows for the incorporation of both uncertainty and new information. In this opinion article, we argue that ROA is a valuable tool, providing the analysis is designed to reflect the real-world characteristics of the decision context. We highlight the differences between traditional risk-based ROA, and scenario-based ROA, and discuss the relative merits of the approaches from the perspective of their assumptions and use of climate information. We also emphasize the need for increased co-development of ROA design and applications with end-users. Given the large climate uncertainties for long-term adaptation planning, we suggest that an emerging strand of scenario-based ROA methods offers ways to help identify and conditionally value flexibility without aggregating values into precise expected values across states of the world.

In order to better understand potentials and limitations of adjusting crop calendars for climate change adaptation of tropical multi-cropping systems with short fallow periods, we used a regionally calibrated Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agronomic model to estimate annual caloric yield and blue water requirement (BWR) of irrigated double-rice and rice-wheat cropping systems in India and Bangladesh. We adjusted crop calendars by (a) single-objective optimization to maximize annual caloric yield and (b) multi-objective optimization to minimize BWR under current and future climate scenarios, focusing on climatic drivers of optimal growing seasons. While the short time intervals between harvest of kharif crops and (trans-)planting of rabi crops limit the space for planting date shift in the study area, our results indicate that crop calendar adjustment has great potential to reverse yield loss induced by temperature rise and decrease BWR by utilizing monsoon precipitation. The study indicates a trend towards earlier planting of rabi wheat to mitigate heat stress during the reproductive stage. Moreover, earlier planting of kharif rice can help to utilize monsoon precipitation, avoid cold stress of kharif rice during anthesis, and allow for early wheat sowing during the historic period. By the 2080s, the increase of heat stress in summer and the decrease of cold stress in winter seems to allow more flexibility for late rice in kharif season, but a conflict between later planting for yield improvement and earlier planting for blue water saving is expected in kharif rice on the Indo-Gangetic plain of India and Bangladesh. Therefore, the trade-off between yield improvement and irrigation water use needs to be carefully considered to promote adaptive adjustment of crop calendars under climate change.","[Wang, Xiaobo; Wang, Shaoqiang; Chen, Bin; Liu, Yuanyuan; Chen, Jinghua] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaobo; Wang, Shaoqiang; Chen, Bin; Liu, Yuanyuan; Chen, Jinghua] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaobo; Folberth, Christian; Skalsky, Rastislav; Balkovic, Juraj] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Biodivers & Nat Resources Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Skalsky, Rastislav] Natl Agr & Food Ctr, Soil Sci & Conservat Res Inst, Bratislava 82109, Slovakia; [Wang, Shaoqiang] China Univ Geosci, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Balkovic, Juraj] Comenius Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Bratislava 84215, Slovakia","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Slovak Agricultural Research Center; China University of Geosciences; Comenius University Bratislava","Wang, SQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Wang, SQ (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;Wang, SQ (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",sqwang@igsnrr.ac.cn,,"Balkovic, Juraj/0000-0003-2955-4931; Wang, Xiaobo/0000-0003-0708-6030","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31,861,143,015]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 31,861,143,015).

Heavy rainfall and ensuing landslides or flooding may lead to road or rail closures; extreme heat can damage road surfaces, or cause tracks, signalling or electronic equipment to overheat, or thermal discomfort for passengers. As extreme weather is expected to occur more frequently in the future, transport infrastructure owners and operators must increase their preparedness in order to reduce weather-related service disruption and the associated financial costs. This article presents a two-sided framework for use by any organisation to develop climate-change-ready transport infrastructure, regardless of their current level of knowledge or preparedness for climate change. The framework is composed of an adaptation strategy and an implementation plan, and has the overarching ambition to embed climate change adaptation within organisational procedures so it becomes a normal function of business. It advocates adaptation pathways, i.e., sequential adaptive actions that do not compromise future actions. The circular, iterative structure ensures new knowledge, or socio-economic changes may be incorporated, and that previous adaptations are evaluated. Moreover, the framework aligns with existing asset management procedures (e.g., ISO standards) or governmental or organisational approaches to climate change adaptation. By adopting this framework, organisations can self-identify their own level of adaptation readiness and seek to enhance it.","[Quinn, Andrew D.; Ferranti, Emma J.

Guided by the literature review, the tool integrates recent advances in using globally available remote sensing data to elicit information on functional diversity and ecosystem service provisioning with information on human service demand and population vulnerability. When combined, these variables can inform climate change adaptation strategies grounded in local social-ecological realities.

To improve microclimatic conditions and to preserve the natural components of related assets, water supply is necessary. As an alternative to drinking water, stream water might serve as a natural source for irrigation. However, due to continuous urbanisation, water courses have often been banned underground in pipes or integrated in the combined sewer network, both making them not directly available for further usage. This article focuses on the perspectives of decoupling captured streams from underground infrastructure to support nature-based urban climate adaptation measures. It introduces a method to identify suitable locations for practical implementation considering the hydrological potential of the stream and the urban microclimatic sensitivity of the concerned area. The approach was applied in a case study in the north-western part of Vienna, including 16 streams with a total length of about 39 km covering an area of approximately 95 km(2) with about half a million inhabitants. This work proved the general practicality of the suggested method. It also revealed that about one-third of the investigated stream lengths appears high or medium suitable to support climate adaption measures, leading to notable cost savings for irrigation (for the substitution of drinking water) and wastewater treatment. Concluding, the decoupling of captured streams could contribute to a more sustainable and nature-based urban water management. The introduced method for suitability pre-assessment is applicable with rather easily available input data, which makes it transferable to other cities.","[Prenner, F.; Kretschmer, F.] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Sanit Engn & Water Pollut Control, Dept Water Atmosphere & Environm, Muthgasse 18, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Muller, H.; Rauch, H.

Reflecting a consolidation of international standards and guidelines and a systematic integration of gender equality perspectives with an emphasis on practical utility, we argue that FIRE can be used at multiple levels of governance by state as well as non-state actors for enhancing DRR, CCA and sustainable development outcomes.","[Scott, Matthew; Ituarte-Lima, Claudia] Raoul Wallenberg Inst Human Rights & Humanitarian, POB 1155, SE-22105 Lund, Sweden; [Ha Nguyen; Boyland, Michael; Biskupska, Natalia] Stockholm Environm Inst, Bangkok, Thailand; [Somboon, Pannawadee] Asian Disaster Preparedness Ctr, Bangkok, Thailand; [Fransson, Lena] Swedish Civil Contingencies Agcy, Stockholm, Sweden",,"Scott, M (corresponding author), Raoul Wallenberg Inst Human Rights & Humanitarian, POB 1155, SE-22105 Lund, Sweden.",matthew.scott@rwi.lu.se,,"Scott, Matthew/0000-0001-5869-869X",Sida,Sida,This work was supported by Sida: [Grant Number].,,26,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Faced with barriers to adaptation planning and implementation at the local level, growing numbers of practitioners have turned to the metropolitan region as a new scalar platform for climate adaptation planning. This study examines regional adaptation planning in Los Angeles, Miami, and Boston, three metropolitan areas that have significant exposure to the impacts of climate change and typify the high levels of administrative fragmentation found in the United States. I ask, what regional adaptation strategies have they deployed? What local adaptation challenges do they try to overcome? Given their progress, what are the implications for this scale of adaptation planning? Drawing on case studies of these efforts, I End that regional collaborations promisingly get more cities to start planning for the impacts of climate change, even in states where governments oppose climate action, by increasing access to information, providing opportunities for networking and technical assistance, helping secure additional funding, and strengthening coordination among vertical levels of government. However, local-centric regional adaptation efforts have had less success in addressing horizontal coordination challenges across municipalities, particularly as they relate to land use planning, fiscal constraints, spillovers effects, and social equity. These findings suggest that scaling up adaptation to the metropolitan region is no panacea for overcoming structural limits to local adaptation in places with weak regional governance institutions. More critical and reflexive regional adaptation planning can help pave the way to difficult conversations around regional institution building so that governance at this scale can achieve its promise of producing more effective and equitable adaptation.","[Shi, Linda] Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, 213 West Sibley Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Shi, L (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, 213 West Sibley Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",lindashi@cornell.edu,,"Shi, Linda/0000-0002-2444-367X","Switzer Foundation Fellowship for Environmental Leadership, Lincoln Institute for Land Policy Dissertation Fellowship [XLS060315]; Martin Family Society of Fellows for Environmental Sustainability","Switzer Foundation Fellowship for Environmental Leadership, Lincoln Institute for Land Policy Dissertation Fellowship; Martin Family Society of Fellows for Environmental Sustainability","This research was supported by the Switzer Foundation Fellowship for Environmental Leadership, Lincoln Institute for Land Policy Dissertation Fellowship (XLS060315), and the Martin Family Society of Fellows for Environmental Sustainability.",,95,25,25,1,27,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Many international and national adaptation strategies consider spatial planning an important policy field for climate change adaptation. Existing adaptation studies, which focus on spatial planning, support these expectations but deliver only a small amount of empirical evidence regarding the specific capacities of spatial planning that support or hinder climate change adaptation. The objectives of this study are firstly to assess how climate change adaptation is addressed in spatial planning systems, and secondly to identify the adaptive capacities of spatial planning to climate change. The study focuses on spatial planning systems in the European Alps and builds upon a content analysis of spatial planning legislation and instruments, as well as an expert survey administered to planning authorities. The findings suggest two approaches for building adaptive capacities: enhancing access to relevant climate information and professional support for spatial planning authorities, and mainstreaming adaptation within the institutional framework of spatial planning.","[Kruse, Sylvia; Puetz, Marco] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research","Kruse, S (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",sylvia.kruse@wsl.ch,"Kruse, Sylvia/E-7096-2014; Pütz, Marco/B-8389-2016","Pütz, Marco/0000-0001-7868-6864",,,,,68,7,8,2,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0965-4313,1469-5944,,EUR PLAN STUD,Eur.

In particular, identifying and addressing constraints on local adaptation mechanisms-whether political, economic or social in nature-is critical to developing effective adaptation policies. The drylands of Kenya present great survival challenges to the people living in these areas. The hilltops in the drylands provide favorable climate and resources for adapting to climate change. The present paper examines the role that one particular hilltop, Endau in Kitui District, eastern Kenya, plays in processes of local adaptation to climatic variability and drought.

Using plot-level data from a specifically designed survey conducted in Pakistan, we investigate the productive benefits for farmers who adapt to climate change. The impact of implementing on-farm adaptation strategies is estimated separately for two staple crops: wheat and rice. We employ propensity score matching and endogenous switching regressions to account for the possibility that farmers self-select into adaptation. Estimated productivity gains are positive and significant for rice farmers who adapted, but negligible for wheat. Counterfactual gains for non-adapters were significantly positive, which is potentially a sign of transactions costs to adaptation. Other factors associated with adaptation were formal credit and extension, underscoring the importance of addressing institutional and informational constraints that inhibit farmers from improving their farming practices.

There is also greater recognition that the rate and magnitude of climate variability and change may exceed the limits to adaptation of socio-ecological systems. We offer an actor-centered, risk-based definition for adaptation limits in social systems. Specifically, we frame adaptation limits as the point at which an actor's objectives cannot be secured from intolerable risks through adaptive actions. These limits are significant because exceeding a limit will either result in intolerable losses on the affected actor or system, or precipitate a discontinuous (or transformational) change of behavior by actors. Such discontinuities in behavior have implications for the distribution of risks, with potentially significant governance consequences. We further argue that some adaptation limits are dynamic through time. We conclude with recommendations for further research into adaptation limits and challenges to risk governance.","[Dow, Kirstin] Univ S Carolina, Dept Geog, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Berkhout, Frans] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Preston, Benjamin L.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of London; King's College London; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Dow, K (corresponding author), Univ S Carolina, Dept Geog, 709 Bull St,Callcott Bldg, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",Kdow@sc.edu,"Preston, Benjamin L/B-9001-2012; Berkhout, Frans/N-4196-2013","Preston, Benjamin L/0000-0002-7966-2386; Berkhout, Frans/0000-0001-8668-0470",European Commission,European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"We would like to acknowledge valuable discussions with Mozaharul Alam, Habiba Gitay, Richard Klein, Guy Midgley, Rebecca Shaw, James Thurlow, and other generous colleagues from IPCC AR5 Working Group 2 who took time to listen and comment on this approach.

In other countries, however, where the economic output from forestry is less significant and interests such as biodiversity, local use and tourism, may figure more prominently, the conditions for developing risk-based forest management may be more manifest.

It is explained with the example of the state of environment indicator 'LUCCA 4 Urban Areas at Risk of Flooding', how SEA as a decision-aiding instrument can contribute to the prevention of conflicts with policy for adaptation to climate change. The method begins with the determination of impact factors for SEA. In the presented study, the physical impact factors of land consumption, land use change, and directed flooding were recognised. A core problem during the selection of indicators for land uses for the adaptation to climate change (here: LUCCA) and the derivation of assessment thresholds was a lack of region-wide policy objectives for the protection of land and resources. Therefore, in a second step, regional environmental orientation objectives were derived from national and EU environmental policy. A standard method for the selection of LUCCA indicators and the derivation of assessment thresholds for conflict analysis is described. Three classes of conflict classification for regional plan designations on the individual site are proposed. It is recommended that future adaptation measures of regional land use planning should be designations of specific land uses as priority areas for urban areas prone to flood risk.

Thus, this study reviews the literature on methodologies and data sources used in LCZs empirical research and identifies recurrent themes. A systematic review was conducted using bibliometric analysis and the PRISMA framework. Web of Science and Scopus databases were used to extract relevant datasets, and records were screened and extracted. Descriptive analyses reveal that most LCZ empirical research has been done on Chinese cities. Numerous data sources and analytical methods have been used, but Landsat and WUDAPT methodology is generally favored in the LCZ research due to its simplicity and freely available global datasets. Similarly, the review also shows that various software and methodologies are available to identify climate-sensitive areas of urban settlements with varying functionalities, accuracy, and visualizations. The thematic analysis indicates that the LCZ framework and its associated processes are being used in crosscutting phenomena such as thermal comfort, urban planning, climate change adaptation, and energy use. The review also suggests incorporating institutional and social aspects in local climate zones. LCZs can integrate the philosophies of climate change adaptation, urban resilience, and sustainability.","[Aslam, Ayman; Rana, Irfan Ahmad] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, H-12 Sect, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan,"Rana, IA (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, H-12 Sect, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.",ayman.aslam96@gmail.com; iarana@nit.nust.edu.pk,"Rana, Irfan Ahmad/C-2560-2017","Rana, Irfan Ahmad/0000-0002-3157-1186",,,,,117,8,8,33,72,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0955,,,URBAN CLIM,Urban CLim.,MAR,2022,42,,,,,,,,101120,10.1016/j.uclim.2022.101120,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2022.101120,,FEB 2022,17,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,0G0UC,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000777768900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The region's climate is projected to become harsher, with increased average temperatures, intensity of rainfall events, and increased variability in space & time of monsoon rains being consistently projected for the region. Without action in the form of adaptation of social, human, economic, and natural resource management systems, these weather changes are predicted to result in decreasing surface and ground water availability, flash floods, degradation of soil resources, decrease in crop yields, greater vulnerability to crop pest outbreaks, and declines in forest and pastureland ecosystem goods and services, thus rendering agricultural and herding communities extremely vulnerable to weather related losses of life, livelihood, and food security. In Rajasthan, government is focussing for sustainable development and climate change adaptation by finding and administering alternative methods to deal with issues of poverty and environmental degradation in context of linkage between livelihood and the immediate environment of the people. The livelihoods of the rural poor are directly dependent on environmental resources like land, water, forests and are vulnerable to weather and climate variability. Climate change affects every aspect of society, environment and economy requiring adjustments in behaviour, livelihoods, infrastructure, laws, policies and institutions in response to experienced based expected climatic events. However, it was found that local coping strategies and traditional knowledge need to be used in synergy with government and local interventions. Solutions must be integrated to address the interrelationships between water, agriculture, forests and pastures, livestock. Finally, there is great potential for existing policies and schemes to be employed synergistically towards building true adaptive capacity for the rural communities. However, adapting to climate change will entail adjustments and implementation at every level from community to national and international.","[Kaushik, G.; Sharma, K.

J,"Carter, JG",,,,"Carter, Jeremy G.",,,Climate change adaptation in European cities,CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY,,,English,Review,,,,,,,,"European cities face a range of challenges over the coming decades that will influence the nature of urban growth and development across the continent. Climate change is central amongst these, and will have direct implications for urban processes through changes to temperature and precipitation patterns. As European cities contribute to and are supported by tightly coupled global networks of socio-economic and biophysical goods and services, many of which are influenced by weather and climate, a changing climate will present complex and uncertain indirect impacts for cities to contend with. Climate change adaptation relates to responding to the risks and potential opportunities associated with changing climates. Although adaptation appears at present to be a relatively low priority issue for city planners and governors in Europe, there are examples from policy and practice that demonstrate positive activity in this field. Although these initiatives do not always have adaptation as their primary focus, they do highlight progress in this arena and offer transferable lessons to other cities aiming to address the impacts of a changing climate. However, there remain a series of barriers to progress that relate to issues such as policy and governance frameworks, and more nebulous issues including complexity and uncertainty in climate science and institutional structures. These barriers must be acknowledged and addressed as a part of an approach that responds holistically to the adaptation challenge that faces European cities in the coming decades.","Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Carter, JG (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",Jeremy.Carter@manchester.ac.uk,,"Carter, Jeremy/0000-0003-1640-3747",,,,,44,110,110,3,58,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1877-3435,1877-3443,,CURR OPIN ENV SUST,Curr.

Conventional approaches to risk assessment are challenged by the significant temporal and spatial dynamics of climate change; by the amplification of risks through societal preferences and values; and through the interaction of multiple risk factors. This paper introduces the theme issue by reviewing the current practice and frontiers of climate change risk assessment, with specific emphasis on the development of adaptation policy that aims to manage those risks. These frontiers include integrated assessments, dealing with climate risks across borders and scales, addressing systemic risks, and innovative co-production methods to prioritize solutions to climate challenges with decision-makers. By reviewing recent developments in the use of large-scale risk assessment for adaptation policy-making, we suggest a forward-looking research agenda to meet ongoing strategic policy requirements in local, national and international contexts.

Frequently climate change adaptation is not a policy field in these small municipalities, which is both a problem and a risk. This paper aims at analyzing the climate policy of small and medium-sized local authorities with specific focus on adaptation. It presents results from a comprehensive survey among approximately 400 small municipalities in Bavaria, Germany. The study analyzes the perception of climate change risks and the perceived need for response, the fields of action, the triggering and influencing factors in the political process, and the people and bodies involved. Our findings reveal that in most cases small municipalities do not follow a strategic and holistic approach for climate change adaptation. Especially among small and very small municipalities, the study shows a gap between discussing climate change and setting up mitigation or adaptation measures. In conclusion, we present three policy implications for increasing the adaptive capacity of small municipalities. These address the increase of awareness of adaptation needs, effective management structures and the mandatory integration of a climate strategy into the long-term local political agenda.","[Bausch, Thomas] Libera Univ Bolzano, Competence Ctr Tourism & Mobil, I-39031 Brunico, Italy; [Koziol, Karin] Munich Univ Appl Sci, Dept Tourism, D-80636 Munich, Germany",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; University of Munich,"Bausch, T (corresponding author), Libera Univ Bolzano, Competence Ctr Tourism & Mobil, I-39031 Brunico, Italy.",thomas.bausch@unibz.it; karin.koziol@hm.edu,,"Koziol, Karin/0000-0001-8576-8155; Bausch, Thomas/0000-0003-2800-5375",Bavarian State Ministry for Environment and Consumer Protection [TUF01UF-66836],Bavarian State Ministry for Environment and Consumer Protection,"This research was funded by the Bavarian State Ministry for Environment and Consumer Protection, grant number TUF01UF-66836.",,77,13,13,2,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR 1,2020,12,5,,,,,,,1894,10.3390/su12051894,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12051894,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KY3KU,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000522470900195,View Full Record in Web of Science

As a consequence, a variety of new spatial development visions, strategies, plans and programmes are being developed by city governments in delta regions to address these risks and challenges. Based on a general conceptual framework, this paper examines the nature of visions, strategies, plans and programmes in the delta cities of Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Rotterdam which are highly exposed to flooding and connected through a network of epistemic communities. The paper follows two main lines of inquiry. First, it examines the terms, concepts, and dominant institutional characteristics associated with the development of these visions, strategies, plans and programmes as a way of constructing a conceptual framework for understanding and explaining their connectivity. Second, it explores how and why cities' spatial plans and governance dynamics are shaping climate adaptation responses. The systematic development of conceptual frameworks and in-depth analyses of varied, representative case studies is needed as their findings have important implications for vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in terms of policy options and cities as the optimal level for adaptation. The paper finds that dominant institutional characteristics critically affect the steering capacity of organisations/agencies (including their coordination capacity) to address climate-related risks. The findings have important implications for vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in cities, in general and delta cities, in particular. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Recognizing the importance and opportunities for mutual learning and knowledge transfer, international and supranational organizations, such as the European Commission, have put programmes for international cooperation in place. This paper presents and tests a framework for assessing multi-level learning outcomes of such international cooperation processes and the conditions that produce these outcomes. The framework distinguishes between: (1) group learning by individual process participants; (2) organizational learning by organizations represented in the process; and (3) network and societal learning by actors external to the process. We verify the analytical potential of the framework by comparing learning by six partners in an adaptation-oriented European cooperation project. The project scores rather high on group learning with participants learning from and - to a lesser extent - also with each other. Learning by partner organizations varied and was generally less whereas learning by external actors was very limited. The case study confirms our expectation that learning outcomes are produced by combinations of partner specific, process-specific and process-external conditions. The presented framework and insights can be used to stimulate learning in and from international cooperation processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Considering that their capacity to adapt to climate change has been undermined not only by the natural vulnerabilities due to their geographic location but also by the social context, gender and institution that interact to influence and determine household and individual vulnerability and responses to drought. Design/methodology/approach - Both primary and secondary data were used. Primary data were collected by use of structured questionnaires from 128 male-headed households and 122 female-headed households in eight villages in the Nguru Local Government Area, as well as from key informant interviews and focus group discussions. Findings - Climate change is not a concept recognized by most farmers and does not have standard translation in the local language; farmers believe the term refers to change in weather. Drought and crop failure are causing despair and frustration, and farmers reported that they are struggling to adapt. The resources and support inputs required for responding to climate change and variability are socially differentiated by gender, women's and men's responses to drought impacts as well as their access to adaptation resources and support differ significantly. Women are in particular unable to access the favored adaptation strategies promoted by Yobe State Agricultural Development Programme as a government support institution assigned with the responsibility of helping farm households adapt to climate change in ways that will increase their adaptive capacity. Originality/value - These findings are essential for informing policy decisions by ensuring that the experiences of both women and men and the context in which they operate are embedded into policy design.","[Yila, Jummai Othniel; Resurreccion, Bernadette P.] Asian Inst Technol, Sch Environm Resources & Dev, Klongluang, Thailand",Asian Institute of Technology,"Yila, JO (corresponding author), Asian Inst Technol, Sch Environm Resources & Dev, Klongluang, Thailand.",jummai.yila@ait.ac.th,,,,,,,33,13,13,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

The need to develop sound adaptation strategies in these areas is growing. Knowledge from the natural sciences has an important role to play in the development of adaptation strategies. However, the extent of and gaps in such knowledge have not been systematically investigated for mountain areas. This paper analyzes the status of knowledge from natural science disciplines and research needs relevant to the national and subnational climate adaptation policies of 1 US state (Washington) and 7 countries (Austria, Bhutan, Colombia, Germany, Nepal, Peru, and Switzerland), in particular the elements of those policies focused on mountain areas. In addition, we asked key individuals involved in drafting those policies to answer a short questionnaire. We found that research needs mainly concern impact and vulnerability assessments at regional and local levels, integrated assessments, and improved climate and socioeconomic data. These needs are often related to the challenges to data coverage and model performance in mountainous areas. In these areas, the base data are often riddled with gaps and uncertainties, making it particularly difficult to formulate adaptation strategies. In countries where data coverage is less of an issue, there is a tendency to explore quantitative forms of impact and vulnerability assessments. We highlight how the knowledge embedded in natural science disciplines is not always useful to address complex vulnerabilities in coupled human and natural systems and briefly refer to alternative pathways to adaptation in the form of no-regret, flexible, and adaptive management solutions. Finally, in recognition of the trans-and interdisciplinary nature of climate change adaptation, we raise the question of which knowledge production paradigms are best able to deliver sustainable adaptations to growing environmental stressors in mountain regions.","[Muccione, Veruska; Salzmann, Nadine; Huggel, Christian] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Salzmann, Nadine] Univ Fribourg, Dept Geosci, Chemin Musee 4, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland",University of Zurich; University of Fribourg,"Muccione, V (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",veruska.muccione@geo.uzh.ch,"Salzmann, Nadine/AAE-4752-2021","Salzmann, Nadine/0000-0001-5876-7624",Indian Himalaya Climate Adaptation Programme (IHCAP); Programa de Adaptacion al Cambio Climatico (PACC) of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC); Swiss Federal Office of the Environment (FOEN); University of Zurich Research Priority Programme on Global Change and Biodiversity (URPP GCB),Indian Himalaya Climate Adaptation Programme (IHCAP); Programa de Adaptacion al Cambio Climatico (PACC) of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC); Swiss Federal Office of the Environment (FOEN); University of Zurich Research Priority Programme on Global Change and Biodiversity (URPP GCB),The writing of this article was funded by the Indian Himalaya Climate Adaptation Programme (IHCAP) and the Programa de Adaptacion al Cambio Climatico (PACC) of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and by the Swiss Federal Office of the Environment (FOEN).

Research on risk management has typically focussed on a static, location-specific understanding of risk and response. However, empirical evidence suggests that risks and vulnerability vary across space and time. Increasingly, responses traverse multiple locations e.g. people move across rural and urban areas, women move beyond the household/community to earn additional incomes. To highlight this dynamic reality of risks and responses, we study livelihood transitions in South India. We unpack risk and response portfolios across scales - household, community, and sub-national (district) levels - and classify them as coping, adaptive and maladaptive. Our findings emphasise that present responses do not necessarily qualify as climate change adaptation strategies. While certain strategies do improve household wellbeing in the short run, there is relatively lower evidence to suggest an increase in adaptive capacity to deal with climatic risks in the future. These findings point to critical gaps in understanding current risk management and how it can contribute to local adaptation policymaking and implementation.","[Singh, Chandni; Rahman, Andaleeb; Srinivas, Arjun; Bazaz, Amir] Indian Inst Human Settlements, 197-36,2nd Main Rd, Bangalore 560080, Karnataka, India; [Rahman, Andaleeb] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Tata Cornell Inst, Ithaca, NY USA",Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS); Cornell University,"Singh, C (corresponding author), Indian Inst Human Settlements, 197-36,2nd Main Rd, Bangalore 560080, Karnataka, India.",csingh@iihs.ac.in,"Singh, Chandni/H-8384-2019","Singh, Chandni/0000-0001-6842-6735; Rahman, Andaleeb/0000-0001-9218-6911","UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada","UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada(CGIAR)","This work was carried out under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA), with financial support from the UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID) and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada.

The article investigates questions such as the following: As climate adaptation researchers, what can and should we do when we are told unsolicited stories? How can storytelling, as a way of life rather than as a source of data, inform and elaborate scientific approaches to adaptation research and planning? In this article, I move away from the literature that seeks to develop narrative methods in adaptation science.

Studies so far relied either on remote sensing-based spatial mapping of physical vulnerability or on certain socio-economic aspects with limited scope for upscaling or replication. The current study is an attempt to develop a holistic and robust framework to assess the vulnerability of coastal India at different levels. We propose and estimate cumulative vulnerability index (CVI) as a function of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, at the village level, using nationally comparable and credible datasets. The exposure index (EI) was determined at the village level by decomposing the spatial multi-hazard maps, while sensitivity (SI) and adaptive capacity indices (ACI) were estimated using 23 indicators, covering social and economic aspects. The indicators were identified through the literature review, expert consultations, opinion survey, and were further validated through statistical tests. The socio-economic vulnerability index (SEVI) was constructed as a function of sensitivity and adaptive capacity for planning grassroot-level interventions and adaptation strategies. The framework was piloted in Sindhudurg, a coastal district in Maharashtra, India. It comprises 317 villages, spread across three taluks viz., Devgad, Malvan and Vengurla. The villages in Sindhudurg were ranked based on this multi-criteria approach. Based on CVI values, 92 villages (30%) in Sindhudurg were identified as highly vulnerable. We propose a decision tool for identifying villages vulnerable to changing climate, based on their level of sensitivity and adaptive capacity in a two-dimensional matrix, thus aiding in planning location-specific interventions. Here, vulnerability indicators are classified and designated as drivers' (indicators with significantly high values and intervention priority) and buffers' (indicators with low-to-moderate values) at the village level. The framework provides for aggregation or decomposition of CVI and other sub-indices, in order to plan spatial contingency plans and enable swift action for climate adaptation.","[Krishnan, Pandian; Rao, Cherukumalli Srinivasa; Sekar, Iyyapa; Kareemulla, Kalakada; Sastry, Regulagedda Kalpana] NAARM, ICAR, Hyderabad 500030, Telangana, India; [Ananthan, Pachampalayam Shanmugam] CIFE, ICAR, Mumbai 400061, Maharashtra, India; [Purvaja, Ramachandran; Jeevamani, Jeyapaul Joyson Joe; Infantina, John Amali; Ramesh, Ramachandran] Anna Univ Campus, Minist Environm Forest & Climate Change, NCSCM, Govt India, Chennai 600025, India; [Anand, Arur] ISRO, RRSC, Reg Remote Sensing Ctr, Nagpur 440010, Maharashtra, India; [Mahendra, Ranganalli Somashekharappa] Govt India, Minist Earth Sci, INCOIS, Hyderabad 500090, India; [Biswas, Amit] Govt India, Minist Stat & Programme Implementat, Indian Stat Inst, Chennai Ctr, Chennai 500090, India","Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - National Academy of Agricultural Research & Management; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Central Institute of Fisheries Education; Anna University; Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT); Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC); Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS); Indian Statistical Institute; Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT)","Krishnan, P (corresponding author), NAARM, ICAR, Hyderabad 500030, Telangana, India.",krishnanars@yahoo.com; ananthanps@gmail.com; purvaja.ramachandran@gmail.com; joyjoejee87@yahoo.com; amaliinfantina@gmail.com; cherukumalli2011@gmail.com; anand_isro@rediffmail.com; mahendra@incois.gov.in; sekariyyapa@naarm.org.in; kalakareem@gmail.com; amit_biswas@hotmail.com; kalpanas.regulagedda@gmail.com; rramesh_au@yahoo.com,"J, Joyson Joe Jeevamani/A-3997-2014; Ramachandran, Ramesh/B-4814-2018; Ramachandran, Ramesh/AAI-1583-2020; Ramachandran, Purvaja/K-5522-2018","Ramachandran, Ramesh/0000-0003-2471-7746; J, Joyson Joe Jeevamani/0000-0001-6619-925X; Mahendra, R S/0000-0001-8974-1662; Ramachandran, Purvaja/0000-0001-7937-3763; /0000-0003-3776-631X","Mangrove Cell of Maharashtra, under the UNDP's Program, Mainstreaming Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Conservation into Production Sectors in Sindhudurg Coast in Maharashtra","Mangrove Cell of Maharashtra, under the UNDP's Program, Mainstreaming Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Conservation into Production Sectors in Sindhudurg Coast in Maharashtra","The framework developed in this study for assessment of coastal vulnerability was benefitted by the insights of Sh.

J,"Flood, S; Schechtman, J",,,,"Flood, Stephen; Schechtman, Judd",,,The rise of resilience: Evolution of a new concept in coastal planning in Ireland and the US,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ZONE MANAGEMENT,"Interest in the concept of resilience has grown significantly in recent years. The perceived strengths of resilience as a concept stem from its foundations in the sciences and humanities, and have recently gained currency amongst political actors and in policy spheres. This papers objective is to investigate the value of resilience as a concept when applied to the process of coastal climate change adaptation with a focus on place specificity. As applied to coastal hazards and climate change adaptation, we expect that resilience encompasses more system complexities than a traditional vulnerability or hazards approach. Our aim in this paper is achieved through carrying out a critical analysis of Irish and US academic and policy literature and determining if, and to what degree, one or more of the three selected lenses of psychological, engineering and ecological resilience are applied. Through contrasting the evolution of coastal adaptation policy developments in both Ireland and the U.S. the paper highlights the importance of policy, environment and geography in the area of coastal management. It furthermore examines the question of whether the concept of resilience represents a paradigm shift, or whether it maintains the dominant anthropological perspective of earlier hazard mitigation approaches under new guise. The increasing focus on climate adaptation as more than enhanced hazard mitigation exemplifies that shift. In the U.S. proposals for large-scale retreat programs post-Sandy are further evidence that combined ecological-anthropological approaches are gaining traction, though planning actions taken and factors considered continue to be dominated by parochialism and anthropocentric or psychological definitions of resilience. In Ireland there is a noticeable increase in the ecological resilience grounded practices of adaptive management and co-management in relation to coastal planning. The fostering of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) frameworks as well as a clear linking between climate adaption and the management of coastal regions underlines this development. Results indicate that resilience, under the three forms explored, is a concept that has recently increased in popularity. Simultaneously, there has been a discernible shift in the direction of broader inclusion of concerns about human environment interactions, but the two are not necessarily coextensive, and concepts of resilience do not always encompass these concerns.

The approach addresses the inability to compile an accurate damage-cost function for economic prioritizations at the local level. It proposes that uncertainty over climate impacts and the efficacy of adaptation responses, in conjunction with the lack of economic data, high levels of economic informality and inequality make it difficult to link adaptation efforts to positive GDP impact in Durban. Instead, the research based its calculations of benefits on the number of people impacted and the extent of the welfare benefits imparted by the respective adaptation efforts. It also took into account the uncertainty over future events, capacity constraints, priorities of decision makers and the risk of maladaptation. The results were reported as benefit-cost ratios for 16 clusters of interventions (many of which were primarily the responsibility of one municipal department or agency) in each of four future scenarios (defined by minor or major climate change and weak or strong socio-institutional capacity). The paper presents and discusses the benefit-cost ratios and total benefits for each of the intervention clusters in each of the future scenarios. It emphasizes how these are influenced by choices of time frames. It also highlights how the most efficient interventions across all futures and time frames tend to be socio-institutional - for instance the creation of a cross-sectoral disaster management forum, sea level rise preparedness and early warning system, and creating climate change adaptation capacity within the water services unit. Ecosystem-based adaptation measures had moderate benefit-cost ratios, probably because in Durban the land that needs to be purchased for this is relatively expensive. Infrastructure-based clusters generally had the lowest benefit-cost ratios.","[Blignaut, James] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [De Wit, Martin] Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Publ Leadership, ZA-7561 Brackenfell, South Africa; [De Wit, Martin] De Wit Sustainable Opt, ZA-7561 Brackenfell, South Africa; [Goldberg, Karen] Kaia Africa, ZA-7950 Cape Town, South Africa; [Mander, Myles] FutureWorks Consultancy, ZA-6570 Knysna, South Africa; [O'Donoghue, Sean; Roberts, Debra] eThekwini Municipal, Environm Planning & Climate Protect Dept, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa",University of Pretoria; Stellenbosch University,"Cartwright, A (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Ctr Cities, Private Bag X3, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.",anton.cartwright@uct.ac.za; jnblignaut@gmail.com; martin@sustainableoptions.co.za; karen.goldberg@gmail.com; myles@futureworks.co.za; Sean.O'Donoghue@durban.gov.za; robertsd@durban.gov.za,"Blignaut, James N/U-1755-2017; de wit, martin p/A-1851-2017","de wit, martin p/0000-0003-3054-2479; Blignaut, James/0000-0001-7059-9010; Cartwright, Anton/0000-0002-2033-9162",,,,,49,29,29,0,63,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0956-2478,1746-0301,,ENVIRON URBAN,Environ.

Finally, it indicates some tasks and methodologies for research agendas of environmental historians in Latin America.","[Mora Pacheco, Katherinne] Univ Pedag & Tecnol Colombia, Fac Ciencias Educ, Escuela Ciencias Sociales, Tunja, Colombia",Universidad Pedagogica y Tecnologica de Colombia (UPTC),"Pacheco, KM (corresponding author), Univ Pedag & Tecnol Colombia, Fac Ciencias Educ, Escuela Ciencias Sociales, Tunja, Colombia.",katherinne.mora@uptc.edu.co,,,,,,,68,1,1,0,3,"FAC LATINOAMERICANA CIENCIAS SOCIALES-FLACSO, ECUADOR",QUITO,"CALLE PRADERA E7-174 & DIEGO ALMAGRO, QUITO, 00000, ECUADOR",1390-6631,,,LET VERDES,Let Verdes,SEP,2018,,24,,,,,8,26,,10.17141/letrasverdes.24.2018.3317,http://dx.doi.org/10.17141/letrasverdes.24.2018.3317,,,19,Environmental Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HJ7QZ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000457393700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This knowledge is especially urgent in developing countries where shoreline change is very likely to inflict economic burdens on coastal communities. Here, we review a CBA shoreline remediation project in Brebes Regency, Indonesia using a mixed method approach (shoreline change analysis, field visits with semi-structured interviews, and participatory community meetings). The findings reveal that the CBA dependent on reactive adaptation measures did not adequately control coastal erosion. Limited coordination between government agencies and the Brebes CBA practitioners, and a poor understanding of the physical processes occurring along the coast, were major barriers to the success of CBA actions. The CBA actions, in fact, exposed the areas to subsequent erosion, making the effort to manage the shoreline change unnecessary and costly. The CBA actions cannot be effective until coordination among the relevant stakeholders, and knowledge of coastal processes, both improve.","[Nguyen Tan Phong] Ton Due Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Nguyen Hao Quang] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Syst & Informat Engn, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Tran Van Sang] Vietnam Acad Water Resources, Inst Ecol & Works Protect, Hanoi, Vietnam",Ton Duc Thang University; University of Tsukuba,"Phong, NT (corresponding author), Ton Due Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",nguyentanphong@tdtu.edu.vn,"Quang, Nguyen Hao/AHI-8067-2022","Quang, Nguyen Hao/0000-0003-0622-0859; Tan Phong, Nguyen/0000-0003-3620-4972",,,,,70,5,5,6,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,MAR 1,2022,218,,,,,,,,106037,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106037,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106037,,JAN 2022,12,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Oceanography; Water Resources,0H2ZB,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000778604300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A key element to overcoming some of these barriers is effective communication of complex scientific information. The use of visualizations, such as photographs or interactive maps, can increase knowledge dissemination, helping community members understand climatic and environmental changes. These techniques have been utilized in many disciplines but have not been widely embraced by climate change scholars. This paper discusses the utility of climate change data visualization as a tool for climate change knowledge mobilization. This paper draws on the case studying drivers of coastline change of Lake Ontario in the Town of Lincoln, Ontario, Canada. Historical aerial photographs were used to measure the rate of coastline change and visualize vulnerable sections of the coast. To better visualize the changes that occurred over time from a resident viewpoint, selected land-based historical photographs were replicated by taking new photographs at the same locations. These visualization tools can be useful to support the community in developing strategies to adapt to climate change by increasing understanding of the changes and knowledge through social learning. These tools can be generalized to other case studies dealing with community engagement in coastal adaptation efforts.

Findings of this study uncovered a number of shortcomings of the government policies and approaches in climate change adaptation. Local initiatives, community learning and ownership seem to be neglected. This research has substantiated the effectiveness and validity of systems approaches and tools in structuring and solving complex issues in agricultural research and development under the interwoven relationships between environmental and human factors. Climate resilient production models and practices are just part of the systemic interventions that need to be implemented in a coordinated manner towards a more resilient future of the farming communities. This study has addressed the current knowledge gap and the need for using integrated approaches and decision support systems for unravelling ill-structured and/or complex issues of climate change adaptation (CCA).

While current human security perspectives helpfully situate the pursuit of climate change adaption within questions of social justice, they have been less forthcoming in providing suitable analytical tools to conceptualize the relationship between power, inequality and vulnerability. To address this gap, insights from political ecology are used to specify the relational dynamics of vulnerability, i.e. the ways in which marginalized peoples are adversely incorporated into political, social and economic relationships that produce their vulnerability while simultaneously creating relative security for others. This perspective is elaborated with examples from Andhra Pradesh, India, where differential control over key productive assets including land, water, labour and credit is key to the hierarchical displacement of security/insecurity across the agrarian population. By foregrounding the relational dynamics of vulnerability, this article provides analytical tools that offer a fuller account of the possibilities and limits to public policy aimed at sustainable climate change adaptation.","Queens Univ, Sch Environm Studies, Dept Global Dev Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Taylor, M (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Sch Environm Studies, Dept Global Dev Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada.",marcus.taylor@queensu.ca,,"Taylor, Marcus/0000-0003-0944-601X",,,,,72,91,92,3,72,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

As a starting point, specific objectives for climate change adaptation need to be articulated, which we consider to be synonymous with the criteria for conservation and sustainable management of boreal forests as defined by the Montreal Process. Secondly, because forest management plans are hierarchal - there are higher level strategic plans and lower level operational plans - it is important to distinguish at which planning level adaptation options are most appropriately considered. The purpose of this paper is to put forward a range of alternative adaptation options that forest managers working in the boreal zone could consider during the development of strategic and operational forest management plans in order to achieve sustainability as defined by the Montreal Process.","Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Resources Management, Sustain Forest Management Lab, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Ogden, AE (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Resources Management, Sustain Forest Management Lab, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",aynslie.ogden@gov.yk.ca; john.innes@ubc.ca,"Innes, John L/E-4355-2013","Innes, John L/0000-0002-7076-1222",,,,,126,59,63,8,71,COMMONWEALTH FORESTRY ASSOC,CRAVEN ARRMS,"CRIB, DINCHOPE, CRAVEN ARRMS SY7 9JJ, SHROPSHIRE, ENGLAND",1465-5489,2053-7778,,INT FOREST REV,Int.

The significance of culture in understanding why people perceive and respond to climate change in particular ways is largely ignored in mainstream climate change adaptation. This paper applies a critical realist approach to examine the sociocultural structures and causal mechanisms for inaction or (in)effective action between at-risk people and the organisations responsible for dealing with climate change. The findings reveal that there are varying context-specific sub-narratives among heterogeneous groups of people at risk and organisations that lead to inaction or (in)effective action in response to climate change, often independent of risk perceptions and with unforeseen consequences for the vulnerabilities of at-risk people. Specifically, sub-narratives may create parallel and/or conflicting climate-related perceptions and respective responses, legitimise unequal resource distribution, and justify the suppression and/or capitalisation of sub-cultural and/or individual risk perceptions.","[Ruehlemann, Anja] Women Engage Common Future, Munich, Germany; [Jordan, Joanne C.] Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Jordan, JC (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",joanne.jordan@manchester.ac.uk,,"Jordan, Joanne/0000-0002-2085-827X",,,,,162,18,18,2,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0361-3666,1467-7717,,DISASTERS,Disasters,APR,2021,45,2,,,,,424,452,,10.1111/disa.12429,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/disa.12429,,OCT 2020,29,"Environmental Studies; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Social Sciences - Other Topics,RA0QF,31851395,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000579848100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

At the same time, there are concerns over its relevance for future adaptation amidst other challenges. This article aims to shed light on some of the key potentials and challenges for the application of local knowledge for adaptation, drawing on recent studies as well as findings from semi-arid Tanzania. This article illustrates how the role of local knowledge at the local level is determined by interaction between informal and formal institutions at the local level. It suggests that assessments of the role of local knowledge for adaptation need to give more consideration to local power relations and the interaction with government strategies, while also addressing structural constraints to the use of local knowledge across scales.

We argue that these two domains of capacity must be addressed explicitly, simultaneously and iteratively if climate change adaptation and sustainable development goals are to be attained. We propose a simple heuristic to understand the four main ways these two capacities interact, leading to more or less desirable outcomes. Drawing from three case studies of agricultural adaptation to climatic risk (Phoenix, AZ; Northeast Brazil; Chiapas, Mexico) we argue that the institutional context of adaptation can implicitly or explicitly undermine one form of capacity with repercussions for the development of the other. A better and more strategic balance of generic and specific capacities is needed if the promised synergies between sustainable development and adaptation are to be achieved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Multistage sampling procedure was used to select 384 small-scale farmers. Percentage and regression were used in the analysis. Among the socio-economic factors, gender positively and significantly influenced adoption of conservation agriculture and water harvesting at 5%, respectively. Among the institutional factors, distance to markets positively or negatively influenced uptake of all the technologies at 1% and 5%, respectively. Due to complementarity in adoption of all the seven adaptation practices, age and distance to nearest markets should be considered during technology dissemination.

This study problematizes the issue of going beyond business-as-usual through a study of the forestry sector in Sweden, which is a large economic sector and could be expected to be an early adapter, given that newly planted forest may stand some 70-90 years into the future. Therefore resources, economic motivation in the longer term and environmental foundations for early adaptation action could be expected to exist. This study draws upon the Foucauldian conceptualization of governmentality to explain the particular institutional logics that nevertheless lead to business-as-usual arguments dominating discussion on adaptation in the case of Swedish forestry. The study emphasizes that adaptation must be seen as steered and limited by existing institutional, social system logics, rather than by externally defined rational motivations. Efforts on adaptation to climate change must thus be considered in relation to, and seek to change, existing institutionally based motivational and incentive structures, and must thus be conceived through social rather than environmental logics. In fact, social logics may even define the types of actions that may be regarded as adaptations.","[Andersson, E.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Resource Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Keskitalo, E.

The analysis is based on the CoastAdapt framework and will be looking at both current and future climate. Vulnerability is split into natural vulnerability, socio-economic vulnerability and institutional vulnerability. Historically, Hammerfest has been vulnerable to avalanches and landslides, and has over time built up considerable climate adaptive experience. Hammerfest is now undergoing deep transformation. The petroleum industry descended on Hammerfest in 2002; ten years later it provides employment for more than 1 000 people in a town with a total population of approximately 10 000. Over this period, new property taxes and other sources of income have made Hammerfest an affluent community. The result is considerable investment in urban development and new infrastructure (schools, a culture center, new sewers and a streets renovation scheme, etc.). In terms of climate adaptation the impact of the oil industry may be seen as a double edge sword. On the one hand, greenhouse gas emissions have rocketed. One the other hand, the economic development has boosted the municipality's revenue and population, thus enabling Hammerfest to consider, and spends money on, local climate adaptive projects that are far beyond the realm of possibility for neighbouring municipalities. The article will look at the instruments employed by Hammerfest in this process. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Water resources are of more concern because changes in the water supply will affect the water availability for household use, agricultural practices, and for the vast industrial water demand. With the view of helping famers to adapt to climate change, the Ceres Dynamic Integrated Model was developed to simulate the impacts and evaluate different adaptation strategies thereof. The results show that a substantial change can be expected in the profile of the farming community. However, with adaptation the welfare of the farmers can be improved. Depending on the availability of funds to make farm dams available for farmers, access to farm dam capacity and winter water allocations as well as increasing water use efficiency are potential adaptation options for the farmers. Improved water management practices that increase the productivity of irrigation water use may provide a significant adaptation potential under future climate. Therefore, farmers must be equipped with a collection of management or adaptation tools to overcome slight climatic differences.","[Ogundeji, Abiodun A.; Jordaan, Henry; Groenewald, Jan] Univ Free State, Dept Agr Econ, Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of the Free State,"Ogundeji, AA (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Dept Agr Econ, Bloemfontein, South Africa.",ogundejiaa@ufs.ac.za,"Jordaan, Henry/AAF-8722-2019","Jordaan, Henry/0000-0003-4845-1727; Ogundeji, Abiodun Akintunde/0000-0001-7356-5668",,,,,16,1,1,0,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

We analyse the attractiveness of a climate risk insurance scheme and the choices farmers face between adaptation via farm management practices and purchase of crop insurance in the market. A choice experiment is used to reveal Danish farmers' preferences regarding an insurance contract where adoption of land management practices to improve soil sustainability is conditional for obtaining insurance cover in the market. Results indicate that in general arable farmers and farmers with low soil quality who have experienced crop damages in the past are more likely to purchase such conditional insurance. Farmers with good quality soils, who perceive that they have already adapted their practices to climatic risks and who have not experienced losses due to adverse climatic events in the past are less willing to purchase insurance.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with formal institutions (e.g. South Australian government agencies) and communities of practice (e.g. farm systems groups) within two natural resource management regions in South Australia. Both groups noted that rural landholders autonomously adapt to a variety of risks, including those induced by climate variability; however, the types and levels of adaptation varied among individuals as a result of variety of barriers to adaptation. The lack of communication and engagement processes established between formal institutions and communities of practice was one major barrier. The paper presents and discusses a model for transferring knowledge and information on climate change among formal institutions, communities of practice, trusted individual advisors and rural landholders, and for supporting the co-management of climate change across multiple groups in rural agricultural areas in Australia and elsewhere.

At present, climate change impacts on the coast, such as storm surges and rising sea levels, are an inevitability and, in some regions, they are already damaging coastal tourism economies. It is clear, therefore, that our relationship with the coast will change. Given the importance of coastal tourism, this new relationship needs to incorporate adaptive measures; including a blue space and wellbeing focus, education and awareness of challenges facing the natural environment. We make this case by re-evaluating the literature on coastal tourism and climate adaptation policies. Using recent examples, we also offer an indication of new policy directions for coastal destinations. At present coastal tourism plans and policies largely ignore how destinations might respond and adapt to climate change impacts.

Water managers and planners on both sides of the border are promoting desalination-the conversion of seawater or brackish groundwater to fresh water-as an adaptation response that can help meet growing water demands and buffer against the negative impacts of climate change on regional water supplies. However, the uneven distribution of costs and benefits of this expensive, energy-intensive technology is likely to exacerbate existing social inequalities in the border zone. In this paper, we examine the discourses employed in the construction of the climate problem and proposed solutions. We focus our analysis on a proposed Arizona-Sonora binational desalination project and use insights from risk and hazards literature to analyze how, why, and to what effect desalination is emerging as a preferred climate change adaptation response. Our risk analysis shows that while desalination technology can reduce some vulnerabilities (e.g., future water supply), it can also introduce new vulnerabilities by compounding the water-energy nexus, increasing greenhouse gas emissions, inducing urban growth, producing brine discharge and chemical pollutants, shifting geopolitical relations of water security, and increasing water prices. Additionally, a high-tech and path-dependent response will likely result in increased reliance on technical expertise, less opportunity for participatory decision-making and reduced flexibility. The paper concludes by proposing alternative adaptation responses that can offer greater flexibility, are less path dependent, incorporate social learning, and target the poorest and most vulnerable members of the community. These alternatives can build greater adaptive capacity and ensure equity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study examines why managers often do not engage their firms in adaptations to climate change. Thereby the study focuses, in particular, on the lack of strategic adaptation, which we define as anticipatory and target-oriented action with the purpose of increasing resilience to climate change. In order to investigate causes of lacking strategic adaptation in firms, the study employs a behavioral perspective based on the reasoned action approach. Thus, the study examines how barriers and motivational factors jointly shape the non-adaptive behavior of firm managers. Such causes of non-adaptive behavior are examined by comparing different classes of non-adaptors based on a case study in the manufacturing industry of the Austrian state of Tyrol. The obtained results underline recent criticism on barrier-centered analyses of non-adaptation by demonstrating the importance of motivational factors. Moreover, results point to the changeable nature of the identified causes of non-adaptive behavior by clarifying interactions between them and by suggesting influences from background factors.","[Meinel, Ulrike] AlpS Ctr Climate Change Adaptat, Grabenweg 68, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Meinel, Ulrike; Hoeferl, Karl-Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Geog, Innrain 52f, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",University of Innsbruck,"Meinel, U (corresponding author), AlpS Ctr Climate Change Adaptat, Grabenweg 68, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.;Meinel, U (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Geog, Innrain 52f, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",meinel@alps-gmbh.com; karl-michael.hoeferl@uibk.ac.at,,"Meinel, Ulrike/0000-0001-6869-2961","COMET - Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology; Austrian Ministry of Science, Research and Economy; state of Tyrol; state Vorarlberg; Tyrolean Chamber of Commerce","COMET - Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology; Austrian Ministry of Science, Research and Economy; state of Tyrol; state Vorarlberg; Tyrolean Chamber of Commerce","This work was conducted within the project adapt X which is supported by the COMET funding program of the Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology, the Austrian Ministry of Science, Research and Economy, the state of Tyrol, and the state Vorarlberg; the COMET program is processed by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG).

Furthermore, monitoring of relevant climatic changes and ongoing research into climate change effects are important elements of a pro-active adaptation strategy. Irreversible decisions, such as the ones on spatial organization, likely require a more active strategy, e. g. in the form of making spatial reservations. We further discuss the interdependency between optimal mitigation and adaptation, an issue that is often overlooked in the literature. Finally, most operators and governmental bodies are not used to dealing with risk and uncertainty, and generally base their decisions on single risk values only, likely leading to under- or overinvestment. We discuss several relevant topics in this area and highlight methods that can be used to better deal with these issues.","[Koetse, Mark J.; Rietveld, Piet] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Rietveld, Piet] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Koetse, MJ (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.j.koetse@vu.nl,"Koetse, Mark/K-9483-2013","Koetse, Mark/0000-0002-9066-8500",,,,,75,28,28,2,29,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-1647,1464-5327,,TRANSPORT REV,Transp.

Here, I analyze two new philosophical arguments that challenge this understanding and claim that probabilistic event attribution is not only forward-looking, but has a potentially significant role in risk-pooling adaptive strategies. I argue the purported forward-looking capabilities of event attribution are based on a mischaracterization of the scientific methodology, and one consequence of this mischaracterization is a limited role in adaptive risk-pooling schemes.","[Lusk, Greg] Michigan State Univ, Lyman Briggs Coll, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Lusk, Greg] Michigan State Univ, Dept Philosophy, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Lusk, G (corresponding author), 919 E Shaw Ln, E Lansing, MI 48825 USA.",greglusk@msu.edu,,"Lusk, Greg/0000-0002-2372-711X",Andrew W.

This paper argues for a relentless push towards the unimpeded involvement of local traditional authorities (LTAs) in the mobilisation of rural communities to adopt appropriate climate change adaptation practices in Zimbabwe. Given its complexity and uniqueness, external intervention through government and non-governmental agents alone can hardly foster climate change adaptation particularly at local levels within communities. Traditional leaders, who have for a long time been useful in the governance of people in various rural communities, can play a supportive role in climate change adaptation. Traditional leaders do not only serve as governance authorities but also know the traditional strategies of combating the negative effects of climate change. Despite the pressure from political interference and the advent of western technological advancement, a lot could still be done to buttress the authority and respect vested in chiefs, headsmen and village heads in the country. LTAs have the power to manage grassroots communities; hence they can be utilised as drivers in the use of traditional climate change adaptation strategies. The paper concludes that political interference is one challenge faced by abusing traditional leadership as a means to gain political mileage. The paper recommends for extended capacity building on the part of traditional leaders to improve their knowledge base. This will enable them to appreciate the integration of indigenous and modern climate change adaptation strategies. It further recommends the revitalisation of the traditional council (Dare raMambo) to deal with environmental offenses with the scope of assisting government efforts to ensure sound ecological practices within communities.","[Musarandega, Happwell; Pillay, Rajendran] Univ Ft Hare, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Alice, South Africa; [Chingombe, Wisemen] Univ Mpumalanga, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Nelspruit, South Africa",University of Fort Hare,"Chingombe, W (corresponding author), Univ Mpumalanga, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Nelspruit, South Africa.",Wisemen.chingombe@ump.ac.za,,"Chingombe, Wisemen/0000-0001-7203-4822",,,,,32,7,6,1,2,AFRICAN CENTRE DISASTER STUDIES,POTCHEFSTROOM,"INTERNAL BOX 265, NORTH-WEST UNIV, PRIVATE BAG X6001, POTCHEFSTROOM, 2520, SOUTH AFRICA",1996-1421,2072-845X,,JAMBA-J DISASTER RIS,Jamba-J.

Multiple sources of uncertainty influence CCA decisions besides climate trends, and their saliency and people's responses vary depending on the role/function of the decision-maker and the timeframe of the decision. Concerns involve situational uncertainties, response options, and their consequences. Decision-makers are more likely to incorporate uncertainties in their adaptation decisions than suppress them or delay action, although the response is sensitive to the type of information sought and timeframes.","[Moure, Mar; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl; Smith-Hall, Carsten] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Moure, M (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Copenhagen, Denmark.",marmoure@ifro.ku.dk,"Smith-Hall, Carsten/L-6015-2018","Smith-Hall, Carsten/0000-0003-3908-3002",European Union [801199],European Union(European Commission),This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 801199.,,123,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2198-6061,,,CURR CLIM CHANGE REP,Curr.

This paper proposes a framework for assessing the costs and benefits of infrastructure adaptation at the local level. The framework consists of three steps: (1) selecting target infrastructure and adaptation options, (2) identifying climate factors, and (3) performing an economic assessment algorithm simulation. The suggested economic assessment algorithm considers both gradual and extreme impacts of climate change and provides an integrated economic assessment over the lifecycle of the infrastructure. Three representative concentration pathways climate scenarios are used to estimate the cost of future damage and the conditions of the assessed infrastructure. A case study is undertaken examining adaptation of an erosion control system in a mountain watershed with an 85-year analysis period that yields a comprehensive understanding of the application of the suggested framework. This research is expected to guide decision making in prioritizing the most cost-effective adaptation strategies for infrastructure.

Social constructivist analyses of environmental policy-especially those emphasising 'framing' - can be very useful in teasing out the framings of policy problems such as adaptation. They can also shed light on the underlying assumptions that steer and guide public and environmental policy. Using the theoretical concept of framing to analyse adaptation policies across different scales of governance in four European countries - Sweden, Finland, the United Kingdom and Italy-and drawing on policy documents from those countries, as well as semi-structured interviews with practitioners, the development of adaptation policy processes and especially how adaptation has been defined within these processes are examined. Four major framings of adaptation are identified: 'planning', 'economic risk', 'vulnerability' and 'existing measures'. These frames affect how adaptation is conceptualised, policy problems defined and, ultimately how policy develops.","[Juhola, Sirkku; Carina, E.; Keskitalo, H.; Westerhoff, Lisa] Umea Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Juhola, S (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, Umea, Sweden.",sirkku.juhola@aalto.fi,"Juhola, Sirkku/GVS-5485-2022","Juhola, Sirkku/0000-0003-0095-2282",,,,,40,49,50,0,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0964-4016,,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

Based on our direct experience with 30 farmers and their advisors, we list five reasons why it is difficult to gain traction with farmers in discussing the likely impacts of climate change on their farms and the possible adaptation options they should be considering in preparation for a future changed climate. The reasons concern the slow and uncertain trajectory for changes in climate relative to the time horizon for farm decision-making, when set against short-term fluctuations in weather, prices, costs and government policy. Farmers have optimism for ongoing technological progress keeping abreast of any negative impacts of climate on their production. As one moves from incremental to transformational adaptation options, biophysical research has less to offer because decisions become based more on business structure, portfolio management, off-farm investments and geographical diversification. Some farmers also doubt the intentions of climate change researchers and are wary of anything they may have to offer. We propose there is an actionable decision space where agricultural science and economics can contribute to meaningful analysis of impacts and adaptation to climate change by farmers. This will involve emphasising the principles of farm management rather than defining optimal farm plans; the use of scenario planning to explore possible futures in a turbulent environment for farming; a focus on short-term adjustments as a path to longer term adaptation; re-gaining the trust of some farmers towards climate change scientists through better communication strategies; and understanding the linkages between adaptation options and enabling factors and technologies.","[Robertson, Michael] CSIRO Agr Flagship, Wembley, WA 6913, Australia; [Murray-Prior, Roy] Curtin Univ Technol, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Curtin University,"Robertson, M (corresponding author), CSIRO Agr Flagship, PMB 5,Wembley Post Off, Wembley, WA 6913, Australia.",Michael.Robertson@csiro.au,"Robertson, Michael J/G-1418-2010",,"CSIRO; Curtin University; Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry through its Australia's Farming Future: Climate Change Research Programme","CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); Curtin University; Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry through its Australia's Farming Future: Climate Change Research Programme(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Agriculture and Water Resources)","While many of the ideas contained in this paper have been informed by thoughtful discussions with farmers, consultants and researchers, we take full responsibility for the views expressed here.

Such development may be attributed to expectations that polycentric governance systems have a higher capacity to deal with complex challenges arising from global and climate change. Most often, employed interpretations of polycentricity emphasize the presence of several independent centers of authority in a governance domain. A commonly neglected feature of polycentric governance, as introduced by Elinor and Vincent Ostrom, is that this concept entails as well operation under one set of overall accepted rules. This paper analyzes the underlying feature of effective polycentric governance and makes a distinction between polycentric, fragmented, and centralized governance regimes. An empirical analysis of water governance systems in 27 national river basins using fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) shows that a set of factors associated with polycentricity has the highest explanatory power for high performance regarding climate change adaptation. Factors associated with fragmented and centralized regimes can be identified for paths leading to low performance. Furthermore, the analysis identifies the effectiveness of formal institutions as important condition, in particular for paths leading toward low performance. The paper elaborates on these findings and discusses as well the potential of fsQCA in such comparative analyses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Like climate change mitigation, work towards adaptation has stalled on the same collective action problem, whereby public and private sector actors avoid commitment to necessary investments. Recently the concept of 'deep adaptation' has appeared, which suggests that, rather than climate change bringing simply incremental challenges that can be adapted to in a piecemeal fashion, in fact, we should expect 'disruptive and uncontrollable levels of climate change, bringing starvation, destruction, migration, disease and war'. However, current port and shipping forecasts continue to predict uninterrupted growth with only minor incremental policy changes already known to be insufficient for mitigation and adaptation. Thus, this paper argues that actors in the maritime transport sector need to consider greater threats than those currently identified and also prepare for a more advanced adaptation timetable.","[Monios, Jason] Kedge Business Sch, Rue Antoine Bourdelle, F-13009 Marseille, France; [Wilmsmeier, Gordon] Univ Los Andes, Bogota, Colombia; [Wilmsmeier, Gordon] Hsch Bremen, Bremen, Germany",Kedge Business School; Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); Bremen University of Applied Sciences,"Monios, J (corresponding author), Kedge Business Sch, Rue Antoine Bourdelle, F-13009 Marseille, France.",jason.monios@kedgebs.com,"Wilmsmeier, Gordon/ABG-9749-2020","Wilmsmeier, Gordon/0000-0001-8848-9004",,,,,111,7,7,6,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-8839,1464-5254,,MARIT POLICY MANAG,Marit.

Climate Change, Common-Pool Resource Theory, and the Adaptability of Western Water Compacts",PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,RIVER,"Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are falling far short of what a consensus of scientists argues is necessary to avoid potentially catastrophic increases in the mean global temperature. Increasingly, attention is devoted to understanding the vulnerability and adaptability of social and ecological systems to climate change in particular areas of the world. In the Western United States and other semi-arid regions of the world, possibly the most immediate, direct impacts of climate change involve the availability of water resources. Scientific evidence suggests that the West is likely to become hotter and drier and will experience greater variability in precipitation. These changes will affect tens of millions of residents in Western states, and nearly every sector of the economy, especially agriculture. The logic of common-pool resource theory is applied in this Theory to Practice essay to assess the vulnerability and adaptability to climate change of interstate river compacts and to off er recommendations for coping with climate change.

And at what spatial and temporal scales will it be needed by Users? Methods and ResultsThis paper presents the results of a two-stage mixed methods study conducted with viticulturists, winemakers and industry representatives in the winegrape sector in Australia. For long-term decision making, participants focus on the concept of future climate analogues as being the most useful form of future climate information. Information provided at spatial scales the size of growing regions adequately meets the needs of most of these Users; and is wanted over time frames of five to 20 years into the future. Importantly, almost three quarters of the participants indicated that the uncertainty surrounding future climate change would not stop them from considering climate change when making decisions about adapting their practices. ConclusionsThis research suggests that the outputs of future climate models are typically presented at the wrong spatial and temporal scales and in a format which is not appropriate for Users in viticulture in Australia.

In Caribbean small island developing states (SIDS), planned adaptation is viewed as essential to address their high vulnerability to climate change, and planning has begun in earnest across the region. However, there has been limited analysis of adaptation planning documents in the region to assess their quality and content. This study assesses adaptation planning documents from Caribbean SIDS, focusing on inclusion of key stages of adaptation planning that were identified from international and regionally specific adaptation guidance instruments. Eighty-nine Caribbean adaptation planning documents-including policies, strategies, programs, and projects-were assessed, revealing that they differ considerably from guidance instruments. Key areas for improvement include the need for (i) more direct linkages between identification of adaptation options and assessments of climate hazards, impacts, vulnerability, and risk; (ii) identification and appraisal of a range of adaptation options; and (iii) increased inclusion and usage of quantitative information about hazards and impacts. Addressing these deficiencies may help to improve the status of adaptation planning in the region and ultimately aid in reducing the high vulnerability of these island nations to the impacts of climate change.","[Thomas, Adelle; Shooya, Omagano; Rokitzki, Martin; Bertrand, Maria; Lissner, Tabea] Climate Analyt, Ritterstr 3, D-10969 Berlin, Germany; [Thomas, Adelle] Univ Bahamas, Univ Dr, Nassau, Bahamas",,"Thomas, A (corresponding author), Climate Analyt, Ritterstr 3, D-10969 Berlin, Germany.;Thomas, A (corresponding author), Univ Bahamas, Univ Dr, Nassau, Bahamas.",Adelle.thomas@gmail.com; Omagano.shooya@climateanalytics.org; m.rokitzki@plan-adapt.org; Maria.bertrand@climateanalytics.org; Tabea.lissner@climateanalytics.org,,"Lissner, Tabea/0000-0001-6637-6084","German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMUB)","German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMUB)","We thank the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) for the funding that supported the research for this study.",,54,9,9,2,16,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

However, while research is increasingly moving away from understanding the relationship between gender and climate change in a linear, technocratic, and instrumental way, gender and climate change policy-makers and project practitioners are having difficulties operationalizing this progress. In the meantime, as climate change effects are increasingly felt worldwide, and because the policy context after the Paris Agreement (2015) is bringing new challenges for gender and equity concerns, (re-)politicizing the climate justice debate in a policy and project-relevant way is more crucial than ever. My aim in this article is to contribute to this endeavor by exploring how a feminist political ecology framework applied to a specific case study in Nicaragua one of the countries most affected by climate change in the world can generate new policy and project-relevant lessons and insights from the ground that can in turn strengthen the conceptual debate on gender and climate change adaptation. Based on ethnographic fieldwork carried out in 2013 and 2014, as well as eight years of professional experience as a development worker in Nicaragua, I discuss the workings of power in the feminist political ecology of climate change adaptation; in so doing I raise new questions that will, I hope, lead policy-makers and project practitioners to explore how adaptation processes could open up the conceptual possibility for emancipation, transformation, and new ways of living life in common.","[Gonda, Noemi] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, Uppsala, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Gonda, N (corresponding author), POB 7012, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",noemi.gonda@slu.se,"Gonda, Noemi/ADV-4464-2022",,Central European University Foundation; Central European University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,Central European University Foundation; Central European University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"This research was partially supported by the Central European University Foundation, a full PhD scholarship by the Central European University, as well as a post-doctoral fellowship by the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.

This study used a cross-sectional data collected from 150 farmers in the Nsawam Adoagyiri Municipality, Ghana. We applied the Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to identify sub-population of pineapple farmers based on their awareness levels of climate change and socioeconomic characteristics. We then used a multinomial logistic regression to examine the extent to which differences in climate change awareness influence adaptation choices. Results indicated that, smallholder pineapple farmers are well aware of climate change and perceived changes in rainfall and temperature patterns. Further, the findings revealed that smallholder pineapple farmers are implementing a host of on-farm and off-farm climate change adaptation practices including irrigation, adjusting planting time, land fragmentation, the use of agmecological knowledge, and seasonal migration. The LCA identified three subgroups of smallholder pineapple farmers based on their level of awareness of climate change - strong climate change awareness group (n = 111; 74%), moderate climate change awareness group (n = 18; 12%) and poor climate change awareness group (n = 21; 14%). Results showed marginal differences in the adoption rate of adaptation practices across the observed subgroups of farmers. We identified that institutional factors including the quality of climate information, quality of extension services, access to credit, education and access to extension services have a stronger effect on climate change awareness and the choice of adaptation practice compared to individual factors such as gender, marital status and farmers' age.","[Antwi-Agyei, Philip; Wiafe, Esther Ako; Baffour-Ata, Frank] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Sci, Kumasi, Ghana; [Amanor, Kofi] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Kumasi, Ghana; [Codjoe, Samuel Nii Ardey] Univ Ghana, Reg Inst Populat Studies, Legon, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Ghana,"Antwi-Agyei, P (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Sci, Kumasi, Ghana.",pantwi-agyei.sci@knust.edu.gh,"Baffour-Ata, Frank/AAL-9001-2021; Antwi-Agyei, Philip/AAI-7392-2020","Baffour-Ata, Frank/0000-0002-6363-732X; Antwi-Agyei, Philip/0000-0002-8599-474X",,,,,65,8,8,3,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2665-9727,,,ENVIRON SUSTAIN IND,Environ.

In the global south, planned adaptation interventions are often implemented by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with the support of bilateral and multilateral donors. This paper examines the influence of external agencies involved in funding, planning and implementation of community-based adaptation (CBA) initiatives in Bangladesh. We show that the principles of CBA are negatively impacted by top-down project design, simplistic notions of community, lack of downward accountability and pressures to meet tight timeframes. We found that NGO-initiated CBA interventions tended to repeat the past mistakes of bottom-up approaches, primarily because of embedded institutional culture that inhibits the possibility of achieving socially just, effective and sustainable adaptation outcomes in Bangladesh. We argue that the automatic and normative attribution of NGO interventions as being good needs deconstructing to ensure that future initiatives are aligned with and prioritise community needs over external expectations. This requires flexible funding, planning and implementation structure for adaptation projects, which may forge new ways of engaging communities and locally led innovation to adapt to climate change.","[Masud-All-Kamal, Md; Nursey-Bray, Melissa] Univ Adelaide, Dept Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Masud-All-Kamal, Md] Univ Chittagong, Dept Sociol, Chattogram 4331, Bangladesh",University of Adelaide; University of Chittagong,"Masud-All-Kamal, M (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Dept Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.;Masud-All-Kamal, M (corresponding author), Univ Chittagong, Dept Sociol, Chattogram 4331, Bangladesh.",masud.kamal@adelaide.edu.au,Masud-All-Kamal/L-8059-2019,Masud-All-Kamal/0000-0003-2412-668X,,,,,91,5,5,3,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,SEP 2,2021,26,9,,,,,1092,1108,,10.1080/13549839.2021.1962829,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2021.1962829,,AUG 2021,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,UJ1NS,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000682462500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While extensive research has been done on detecting significant observed trends in hydroclimate variables and attribution to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in large continents, less attention has been paid for regional scale analysis. The latter is mainly important for adaptation to climate change in different sectors including but not limited to energy, agriculture, and water resources planning and management, and it is still an open discussion in many countries including the West Asian ones. In the absence of regional climate models, an informative framework is suggested providing useful insights for policymakers. It benefits from general flexibility, not being computationally expensive, and applying several trend tests to analyze temporal variations in temperature and precipitation (gradual and step changes). The framework is implemented for a very important river basin in the west of Iran. In general, some increasing and decreasing trends of the interannual precipitation and temperature have been detected. For precipitation annual time series, a reducing step was seen around 1996 compared with the gradual change in most of the stations, which have not experience a dramatical change. The range of natural forcing is found to be +/- 76 % for precipitation and +/- 1.4 A degrees C for temperature considering a two-dimensional diagram of precipitation and temperature anomalies from 1000-year control run of global climate model (GCM). Findings out of applying the proposed framework may provide useful insights into how to approach structural and non-structural climate change adaptation strategies from central governments.","[Zohrabi, Narges] Islamic Azad Univ, Ahvaz Branch, Dept Water Sci & Engn, Ahvaz, Iran; [Goodarzi, Elahe] Univ Yazd, Dept Watershed Management, Coll Nat Resources, Yazd, Iran; [Bavani, Alireza Massah; Najafi, Husain] Univ Tehran, Dept Water Resources Engn, Coll Abouraihan, Pakdasht, Iran",Islamic Azad University; University of Yazd; University of Tehran,"Zohrabi, N (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Ahvaz Branch, Dept Water Sci & Engn, Ahvaz, Iran.",nzohrabi@iauahvaz.ac.ir,"zohrabi, narges/AAN-4501-2021","Massah Bavani, Ali Reza/0000-0002-5433-1791; Zohrabi, Narges/0000-0003-2187-3110",,,,,62,1,1,1,13,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

Second, at a follow-up Workshop we worked with the community to explore the potential for adaptation options to provide 'solutions' to these issues, exploring who the winners and losers would be for each option, and what would be required to enable the options to be actioned.

A biophysical economic modelling approach was used over a 60-year period to assess changes in crop productivity, total welfare and land-use options. The results indicate varying decreases in crop yield. For instance, when compared to the crop yield in 2010, maize yield decreased by -20% under subsistence farming and -0.1% under intensive farming in the seventh decade (2061 to 2070). Adaptation to climate change effects increased total welfare by 24% and producer revenues by 44% when compared to no adaptation. To optimise the welfare of smallholder farmers in Malawi, the study recommends increasing the adoption of intensive farming, conservation agriculture and Falbedia albida to at least 9.5%, 12% and 10% of total cultivated area in the 7th decade respectively. The study also reveals that farmers' inability to optimise land use has a higher negative impact on welfare when compared to the effect from climate change. This means that the optimisation of crop and technology choices may play a more vital role in improving farmers' welfare than mere adaptation to climate change.","[Kachulu, Mutisungilire] Univ Hamburg, Sch Integrated Climate Syst Sci, Sustainabil & Global Change Res Unit, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Kachulu, M (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Sch Integrated Climate Syst Sci, Sustainabil & Global Change Res Unit, Hamburg, Germany.",mutiekachulu@gmail.com,,,World Wildlife Fund (WWF USA); Climate Research Systems Group; School of Integrated Climate Systems (SICS); Integrated Climate System Analysis and Prediction (CliSAP) Cluster of Excellence at the University of Hamburg,World Wildlife Fund (WWF USA); Climate Research Systems Group; School of Integrated Climate Systems (SICS); Integrated Climate System Analysis and Prediction (CliSAP) Cluster of Excellence at the University of Hamburg,"The author would like to acknowledge with thanks the financial assistance from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF USA) and the Climate Research Systems Group, and the University of Cape Town for providing the climate scenario data.

The complexity of climate change as threat, environmental stressor, risk domain, and impacting process with dramatic environmental and human consequences requires a synthesis of perspectives and models from diverse areas of psychology to adequately communicate and explain how a more psychological framing of the human dimensions of global environmental change can greatly inform and enhance effective and collaborative climate change adaptation and mitigation policies and research. An integrative framework is provided that identifies and considers important mediating and moderating parameters and processes relating to climate change adaptation, with particular emphasis given to environmental stress and stress and coping perspectives. This psychological perspective on climate change adaptation highlights crucial aspects of adaptation that have been neglected in the arena of climate change science. Of particular importance are intra-individual and social psychological adaptation processes that powerfully mediate public risk perceptions and understandings, effective coping responses and resilience, overt behavioral adjustment and change, and psychological and social impacts. This psychological window on climate change adaptation is arguably indispensable to genuinely multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research and policy initiatives addressing the impacts of climate change.","[Reser, Joseph P.] Griffith Univ, Sch Psychol, Griffith, Qld 4222, Australia; [Swim, Janet K.] Penn State Univ, Dept Psychol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Griffith University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Reser, JP (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Psychol, Gold Coast Campus, Griffith, Qld 4222, Australia.",j.reser@griffith.edu.au,,"Swim, Janet/0000-0002-3279-1308; Reser, Joseph/0000-0002-1139-6587",,,,,138,172,177,8,117,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0003-066X,1935-990X,,AM PSYCHOL,Am.

Based on the theory of adaptive management, this paper selects Yuanping City from Shanxi Province, Qingyuan County from Liaoning Province, and Kulun Banner from Inner Mongolia as representative cases in agricultural, forestry, and pastoral areas, respectively, to carry out field research, and it uses 1970-2017 meteorological station data to apply vulnerability assessment and climate element change trend analysis, combined with the meteorological hazards data, and explore the adaptive management measures for agricultural, forestry, and pastoral areas in China. The conclusions are as follows: (1) the vulnerability of precipitation in Yuanping is high, the increase in temperature and drought and floods are the most important factors affecting crop yields in agricultural areas, and the key to climate change adaptive management lies in the awareness of farmers of climate change risks and the institutional guarantee of the government; (2) Qingyuan has high temperature vulnerability, and the forest areas have relatively strong adaptive capacity to climate change, but climate change will significantly affect the forest's carbon sequestration function, and the focus of climate change adaptive management in the forestry sector is on engineering and technology field practices; (3) Kulun has the highest vulnerability to climate change, the frequent meteorological disasters seriously impact livestock development, and climate change adaptive management in pastoral areas relies on the participation of pastoralists' local knowledge and also needs the support of the government and society.","[Xuan, Xin; Liu, Bing] Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geodesy & Geomat, Qingdao 266590, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Fan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Shandong University of Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Liu, B (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geodesy & Geomat, Qingdao 266590, Peoples R China.",xuanx@sdust.edu.cn; lb@sdust.edu.cn; zhangf.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Fan, Zhang/AAZ-3509-2021",,Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA23070402],Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"This research was funded by the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, grant number XDA23070402.",,56,0,0,10,33,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,AUG,2021,10,8,,,,,,,832,10.3390/land10080832,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land10080832,,,17,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UG9UV,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000689588700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

An important domain in which citizen responsibilisation is advocated is that of urban climate change adaptation. However, in practice, the advocated shift is taking place only to a limited extent. This study aims to help explain this by researching Dutch local governments' perceptions on citizens' capabilities as well as these governments' preferences regarding the tasks they want to delegate to citizens in the different stages of adaptation planning. Findings from three workshops with policy practitioners from local governments show that these practitioners have moderate trust in citizens' capabilities, but a low willingness to transfer responsibilities. Concerns of local governments include how to: (i) ensure an equal division of resources between different citizen groups/neighbourhoods; (ii) address citizens who are pursuing their own benefits more than producing a public adaptation good; (iii) address potential externalities for other citizens; (iv) guarantee a certain quality level for the public space. The study shows that local governments have an implicit awareness of different dimensions of responsibility and the tensions between them, including at least: responsibility as a task, as a legal duty, and as something for which one can be held accountable. We recommend a more explicit discussion of these dimensions in practice and a more systematic treatment of them in conceptual and in empirical studies.","[Uittenbroek, Caroline J.; Mees, Heleen L.

As many rural agricultural practices are heavily impacted by male-centered traditional customs and mores, gender dimensions can determine the level of success for policy interventions. To better understand how and what gender dimensions can be important factors for farmer's climate change adaptations, this study attempts to examine smallholder farmers' adaptation needs and perspectives in Ghana's Upper East Region. A focus group discussion and a questionnaire survey were conducted among 200 smallholder farmers. We found that the female respondents, who mostly belonged to low/middle-income groups, emphasized their urgent need for financial support to improve their income. They needed more farmland as 94% of them had only less than 5 acres to farm. In addition, 91% of the female respondents expressed the importance of being connected to farmers' mutual-help groups to share information about common farming needs. We also found gender-specific needs for extension services, farm inputs, climate information, mechanization, and infrastructure. Regarding access to resources, the women respondents had little interest in investing more in farming as the land they borrowed could be taken away by male owners. The study recommends the need for gender-specific support initiatives that prioritize social protection and gender equality.","[Nuhu, Mohammed Gali] Univ Tsukuba, Doctoral Program Environm Studies, Life & Earth Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan; [Matsui, Kenichi] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Life & Environm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan",University of Tsukuba; University of Tsukuba,"Nuhu, MG (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Doctoral Program Environm Studies, Life & Earth Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan.",s2030293@s.tsukuba.ac.jp,,"Mohammed Gali, Nuhu/0000-0001-8618-9331",JST-Support for Pioneering Research Initiated by Next Generation (SPRING) [JPMJSP2124],JST-Support for Pioneering Research Initiated by Next Generation (SPRING),"This study was supported by JST-Support for Pioneering Research Initiated by Next Generation (SPRING), Grant Number JPMJSP2124.",,43,1,1,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2022,14,16,,,,,,,10432,10.3390/su141610432,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141610432,,,11,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,4A7KG,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000845274700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

One limitation is land use change caused by urbanization. Global policies prove the need to undertake action in order to develop more sustainable human settlements, which would be adapted better to potential future climate change effects. Among such changes are the increase of average temperatures and extreme events like heat waves. Those changes are more severe in urban areas due to land use development, and result in the urban heat island effect (UHI), which has a negative impact on the thermal comfort of citizens. The paper presents a decision support system that can be used for the assessment of areas to the potential exposure to the UHI effect. The system integrates scenario analysis, land use modelling in cellular automata (Metronamica), and an indicator-based assessment in a geographic information system (ArcGIS). The applicability of the model is illustrated through developing scenarios for the future land use allocation of the Wroclaw Larger Urban Zone (Poland). The results of the calculations show which scenario is the least vulnerable to UHI effects. Moreover, for each scenario, cores of urban areas were identified, in which certain urban design patterns accounting for adaptation to climate change could be implemented. The study provides a guideline for local authorities on where to focus actions in order to create more sustainable urban structures and to better adapt to climate change and environmental extremes.","[Kazak, Jan K.] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Fac Environm Engn & Geodesy, Dept Spatial Econ, Ul Grunwaldzka 55, PL-50357 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences,"Kazak, JK (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Fac Environm Engn & Geodesy, Dept Spatial Econ, Ul Grunwaldzka 55, PL-50357 Wroclaw, Poland.",jan.kazak@upwr.edu.pl,"Kazak, Jan/S-7783-2016","Kazak, Jan/0000-0002-1864-9954",,,,,81,59,60,1,45,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2018,10,4,,,,,,,1083,10.3390/su10041083,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10041083,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ3IY,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000435188000187,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach - The paper utilises results from a multi-level study of adaptation policy conducted in early 2009 to assess the different approaches to climate change, the production of climate information, and its application at national and select sub-national levels in Italy and Finland. Data were collected via a preliminary review of relevant documents as well as 23 interviews in Italy and 21 interviews in Finland conducted with climate change and environmental policy actors at each scale of administration. Findings - The paper shows while the different extent and processes of climate research and their linkages to policy can be seen as determinants of the development of adaptation measures, the multi-scalar adaptation decision-making processes and the ways in which climate change and climate information are framed and used render climate research and its application a complex process. Originality/value - The paper contributes further understanding of the linkages between science and policy with regards to adaptation, and the nature of science-policy linkages in local decision-making processes in particular. The findings are of importance to climate scientists and policy-makers alike.","[Westerhoff, Lisa] Umea Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, Umea, Sweden; [Juhola, Sirkku] Aalto Univ, YTK Ctr Urban & Reg Studies, Aalto, Finland",Umea University; Aalto University,"Westerhoff, L (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, Umea, Sweden.",lisa.westerhoff@gmail.com,"Juhola, Sirkku/GVS-5485-2022","Juhola, Sirkku/0000-0003-0095-2282",,,,,60,10,10,1,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

However, smallholder farmers and governments in these regions tend to be ill-prepared for the impacts of climate change. We present the results of a stakeholder-based multi-criteria analysis of climate change adaptation options for agriculture, natural resource management and water management in the upper Blue-Nile basin in Ethiopia. We use the PROMETHEE II outranking method to analyse data from a survey in which farmers and experts were asked to evaluate adaptation options based on potentially conflicting criteria. Adaptation options for soil and land management, such as crop rotation and composting, score high based on two sets of criteria for assessing adaptation options for agriculture. River diversion, preventing leaching and erosion, and drip irrigation are ranked highest as adaptation options for water management. Regarding natural resource management, the highest ranked adaptation options are afforestation, water retention and maximizing crop yield. Rankings by farmers and by experts are weakly correlated for agriculture and water management, and negatively correlated for natural resource management, which shows the importance of extension services and of involving farmers in the decision-making process to ensure the feasibility of adaptation options.","[Nigussie, Yalemzewd; van der Werf, Edwin; Zhu, Xueqin; van Ierland, Ekko C.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands; [Nigussie, Yalemzewd; Simane, Belay] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [van der Werf, Edwin] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Wageningen University & Research; Addis Ababa University; Ifo Institut,"van der Werf, E (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",,"Zhu, Xueqin/K-9471-2013","Zhu, Xueqin/0000-0002-5772-1090; van der Werf, Edwin/0000-0001-7609-9340",Netherlands Fellowship Programmes [CF8195/2012],Netherlands Fellowship Programmes,Nigussie is grateful to Netherlands Fellowship Programmes for funding through Grant CF8195/2012.,,53,15,15,1,33,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The purpose of this research is to make a literature review on the topic of climate change adaptation and building maintenance and use it as the base to point out possible further developments regarding maintenance planning contribution to the adaptation of building stock management. The implementation of maintenance activities with this aim is still incipient and based on theoretical approaches. Despite the scarcity of research on this topic, the literature covers several relevant complementary tools to maintenance planning, also included in the present paper, considering their essential role to the efficient implementation of climate change adapted maintenance.

J,"Kiem, AS; Austin, EK",,,,"Kiem, Anthony S.; Austin, Emma K.",,,"Drought and the future of rural communities: Opportunities and challenges for climate change adaptation in regional Victoria, Australia",GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Drought; Climate change adaptation; Vulnerability; Uncertainty; Barriers; Disconnect,MURRAY-DARLING BASIN; WATER; EXPERIENCE; RESOURCES; DRIER; RISK,"Australia's vulnerability to climate variability and change has been highlighted by the recent drought (i.e. the Big Dry or Millennium Drought), and also recent flooding across much of eastern Australia during 2011 and 2012. There is also the possibility that the frequency, intensity and duration of droughts may increase due to anthropogenic climate change, stressing the need for robust drought adaptation strategies. This study investigates the socio-economic impacts of drought, past and present drought adaptation measures, and the future adaptation strategies required to deal with projected impacts of climate change. The qualitative analysis presented records the actual experiences of drought and other climatic extremes and helps advance knowledge of how best to respond and adapt to such conditions, and how this might vary between different locations, sectors and communities. It was found that more effort is needed to address the changing environment and climate, by shifting from notions of 'drought-as-crisis' towards acknowledging the variable availability of water and that multi-year droughts should not be unexpected, and may even become more frequent. Action should also be taken to revalue the farming enterprise as critical to our environmental, economic and cultural well-being and there was also strong consensus that the value of water should be recognised in a more meaningful way (i.e. not just in economic terms). Finally, across the diverse stakeholders involved in the research, one point was consistently reiterated: that 'it's not just drought'. Exacerbating the issues of climate impacts on water security and supply is the complexity of the agriculture industry, global economics (in particular global markets and the recent/ongoing global financial crisis), and demographic changes (decreasing and ageing populations) which are currently occurring across most rural communities. The social and economic issues facing rural communities are not just a product of drought or climate change - to understand them as such would underestimate the extent of the problems and inhibit the ability to coordinate the holistic, cross-agency approach needed for successful climate change adaptation in rural communities.

The purpose of this paper is to explore smallholder farmers' perceptions of climate change and compare it with meteorological data, as well as to identify perceived adaptation barriers and examine the factors that influence the choice of adaptation options in eastern Ethiopia. Design/methodology/approach In total, 384 sample households were chosen from four districts of the zone. A cross-sectional survey was used to conduct the study. Primary data was acquired through key informant interviews, focus group discussions and semistructured interviews, whereas meteorological data was collected from the National Meteorological Service Agency of Ethiopia. A Mann-Kendall statistical test was used to analyze temperature and rainfall trends over 33 years. A multivariate probit (MVP) model was used to identify the determinants of farmers' choice of climate change adaptation strategies. Findings The result indicated that temperature was significantly increased, whereas rainfall was significantly reduced over the time span of 33 years. This change in climate over time was consistently perceived by farmers. Smallholder farmers use improved varieties of crops, crop diversification, adjusting planting dates, soil and water conservation practices, reducing livestock holdings, planting trees and small-scale irrigation adaptation strategies. Moreover, this study indicated that sex of the household head, landholding size, livestock ownership, access to extension, access to credit, social capital, market distance, access to climate change-related training, nonfarm income, agroecological setting and poverty status of the households significantly influence farmers' choice of adaptation strategies. Research limitations/implications Further research is required to evaluate the economic impact of each adaptation options on the livelihood of smallholder farmers. Practical implications Institutional variables significantly influenced how farmers adapted to climate change, and all of these issues might potentially be addressed by improving institutional service delivery. To improve farm-level adaptation, local authorities are recommended to investigate the institutional service provision system while also taking demographic and agroecological factors in to account. Originality/value This study compared farmers' perceptions with temperature and rainfall trend analysis, which has been rarely addressed by other studies. This study adopts an MVP model and indicated the adaptation strategies that complement/substitute strategies each other. Furthermore, this study discovered that the choice of adaptation options differed between poor and nonpoor households, which has been overlooked in previous climate change adaptation research.","[Zeleke, Titay] Debre Markos Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Debre Markos, Ethiopia; [Zeleke, Titay] Haramaya Univ, Africa Ctr Excellence Climate Smart Agr & Biodive, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia; [Beyene, Fekadu; Yousuf, Jemal] Haramaya Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia; [Deressa, Temesgen] George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC USA; [Kebede, Temesgen] Haramaya Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia",Haramaya University; Haramaya University; George Washington University; Haramaya University,"Zeleke, T (corresponding author), Debre Markos Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Debre Markos, Ethiopia.;Zeleke, T (corresponding author), Haramaya Univ, Africa Ctr Excellence Climate Smart Agr & Biodive, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia.",titayzeleke@gmail.com,,,"Africa Centre of Excellence for Climate Smart Agriculture and Biodiversity Conservation, Haramaya University; Debre Markos University","Africa Centre of Excellence for Climate Smart Agriculture and Biodiversity Conservation, Haramaya University; Debre Markos University","Africa Centre of Excellence for Climate Smart Agriculture and Biodiversity Conservation, Haramaya University, and Debre Markos University funded this research as part of a PhD study.",,56,0,0,6,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

They have become prominent policy tools used to address coastal squeeze of intertidal habitats occurring from sea-level rise and 'hold-the-line' management approaches. This policy development is evaluated against scientific evidence and its broader ethical dimensions regarding conservation of the natural environment. A case study is provided from the UK (England) where the National Habitat Compensation Programme aims to continue conservation obligations consistent with the EU Habitats Directive and Natura 2000. Progress is also referenced against Shoreline Management Plans and aspirations for a greater proportion of the coast to shift to managed realignment in response to sea level rise. Important barriers are identified, and issues of monitoring, transparency, and robustness are highlighted regarding habitat compensation and general coastal policy. At present, habitat compensation is based upon a simple area-based balance sheet approach which overlooks key uncertainties and gives a misleading indication of progress. Climate change adaptation planning needs to include more flexibility based upon alternative scenarios and response pathways, especially regarding recent evidence for higher future sea-level rises. Robust responses also require more emphasis on improved interpretation of ecological functioning, integrity, and coherence, as essential concepts to facilitate ecosystem based adaptation consistent with international conventions and application of the precautionary principle.","[Brown, Iain] Univ Dundee, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland",University of Dundee,"Brown, I (corresponding author), Univ Dundee, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.",ixbrown@dundee.ac.uk,"Brown, Iain/M-7580-2017","Brown, Iain/0000-0002-3469-5598",,,,,108,1,1,4,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,MAR 15,2022,219,,,,,,,,106072,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106072,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106072,,FEB 2022,11,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Oceanography; Water Resources,0E6FX,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000776776400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The platform comprises a number of components including: (i) a metadata discovery tool to support modelling, (ii) a workflow framework for connecting climate change models, (iii) geographical visualisation tools for communicating landscape and farm impacts, (iv) a landscape object library for storing and sharing digital objects, (v) a landscape constructor tool to support participatory decision-making, and (vi) an online collaboration space for supporting multi-disciplinary research and cross-organisational collaboration. In this paper we present the platform as it has been developed to support collaborative research and to inform stakeholders of the likely impacts of climate change in southwest Victoria, Australia. We discuss some of the drivers for research in developing the ecoinformatics platform and its components.

Here, we propose a method for the systematic assessment and selection of policy instruments for stimulating adaptation action. The multi-disciplinary set of six assessment criteria is derived from economics, policy, and legal studies. These criteria are specified for the purpose of climate adaptation by taking into account four challenges to the governance of climate adaptation: uncertainty, spatial diversity, controversy, and social complexity. The six criteria and four challenges are integrated into a step-wise method that enables the selection of instruments starting from a generic assessment and ending with a specific assessment of policy instrument mixes for the stimulation of a specific adaptation measure. We then apply the method to three examples of adaptation measures. The method's merits lie in enabling deliberate choices through a holistic and comprehensive set of adaptation specific criteria, as well as deliberative choices by offering a stepwise method that structures an informed dialog on instrument selection. Although the method was created and applied by scientific experts, policy-makers can also use the method.","[Mees, Heleen L. P.; Driessen, Peter P.

To date, however, the use of the term values has been narrowly focused on monetary worth, relative worth, or fair return on exchanges. This article argues that another, broader interpretation of values, one concentrating on intrinsically desirable principles or qualities is needed to understand and respond to climate change. How to respond to climate change impacts depends importantly on what the effects of climate change mean to those affected. Similarly, what is considered as effective and legitimate adaptation depends on what people perceive to be worth preserving and achieving. How to adapt to climate change therefore hinges on the values underlying people's perspectives on what the goals of adaptation should be. This article examines what a values-based approach is, why it is needed, and what its benefits for understanding adaptation are. The implications for research and policy are discussed.

Using a framework focusing on advocacy coalitions, we analyze how the adaptation debate in the forestry sector evolved over the period; who the main advocates for and against adaptation were; and which main arguments and processes affected the debate and policy. The results show that academics advocating climate change adaptation, aided by outside influences, such as political pressure for adaptation responses and the negative impacts of the 2005 storm Gudrun, contributed to an increased general awareness and understanding of adaptation issues amongst forestry stakeholders. Nonetheless, the strong dominance of actors arguing for increased forest production and the limited number and relatively poor organization of adaptation advocates have acted as barriers to mainstreaming adaptation concerns into forestry policy and practice. The dominant coalitions and their values have also determined the direction of debate and policy. The main conclusions for policymakers aiming to further this integration process are the importance of stimulating adaptation coalitions and the value of creating arenas for multiple stakeholder learning about adaptation.","[Ulmanen, Johanna] SP Tech Res Inst Sweden, SE-41261 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Swartling, Asa Gerger] Stockholm Environm Inst, SE-10451 Stockholm, Sweden; [Swartling, Asa Gerger] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Wallgren, Oskar] WSP Sverige AB, SE-12188 Stockholm, Sweden",SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden; Stockholm Environment Institute; Stockholm University,"Ulmanen, J (corresponding author), SP Tech Res Inst Sweden, Eklandagatan 86, SE-41261 Gothenburg, Sweden.",Johanna.ulmanen@sp.se; asa.swartling@sei-international.org; oskar.wallgren@wspgroup.se,"Swartling, Åsa C Gerger/J-1420-2018","Swartling, Åsa C Gerger/0000-0003-3616-7323; Ulmanen, Johanna/0000-0003-1025-7267",Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (Mistra),Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (Mistra)(Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research),"The authors acknowledge the financial support of the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (Mistra).

While there is a considerable body of literature on the scale of the problem, there is very little research on the lived experiences of communities, their concerns and priorities, and how they are coping with environmental and climate hazards. As a result, a top-down approach is often adopted in adaptation projects that may not meet the real needs of communities, endangering the long-term sustainability and viability of interventions. Through a series of participatory focus groups carried out in Kiribati in 2019, this study explores what communities prioritise and wish to see implemented to cope and build resilience to present and foreseeable future challenges. The outcomes of this research show environmental risks and hazards faced by communities are strongly associated with climate projections. Communities are currently trying to adapt to challenges, both old and new, with technologies and materials available. While there is a degree of spontaneous adaptation occurring, these problems are insurmountable without solving present challenges in Kiribati, such as access to better technology and markets without becoming over-reliant. Including communities in co-designed interventions can also ensure sustainability in climate adaptation projects. The findings of this research can inform policy and climate change adaptation measures in other similar atoll islands in the Pacific.","[Cauchi, John Paul; Bambrick, Hilary; Correa-Velez, Ignacio] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Publ Hlth & Social Work, O Block,C Wing,Victoria Pk Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Moncada, Stefano] Univ Malta, Inst European Studies, Malta, Malta; [Moncada, Stefano] Univ Malta, Isl & Small States Inst, Malta, Malta; [Correa-Velez, Ignacio] Queensland Program Assistance Survivors Torture &, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Malta; University of Malta,"Cauchi, JP (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Publ Hlth & Social Work, O Block,C Wing,Victoria Pk Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",j.cauchi@qut.edu.au,"; Moncada, Stefano/R-4178-2016","Bambrick, Hilary/0000-0001-5361-950X; Cauchi, John Paul/0000-0001-8983-8499; Moncada, Stefano/0000-0002-2235-6046",Queensland University of Technology through its Postgraduate Research Awards (QUTPRA); School of Public Health and Social Work (SPHSW),Queensland University of Technology through its Postgraduate Research Awards (QUTPRA); School of Public Health and Social Work (SPHSW),This work was supported by the Queensland University of Technology through its Postgraduate Research Awards (QUTPRA) and its School of Public Health and Social Work (SPHSW) .,,73,3,3,3,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2211-4645,2211-4653,,ENVIRON DEV,Environ.

Law can facilitate adaptation, using regulation to reduce exposure or sensitivity to climate hazards, establishing the legal architecture for new market mechanisms, and funding arrangements for adaptation costs and liability for climate impacts. It can also ensure the accountability of adaptation decision making and addressing some of the social justice dimensions of adaptation. Yet there are also characteristics of legal institutions, processes, and principles that may impede adaptation, including by creating compensable property rights that hinder new regulation. There are several characteristics of climate change and associated impacts that will make law-making for adaptation uniquely challenging. These include high levels of cascading uncertainty, irreversibility, the context-specificity of impacts, the long delay between emissions and impacts, and the interaction between climate change impacts and other environmental, social, and economic stressors. Laws dealing with substantive climate impacts may be appropriate and necessary in some cases, but the broader challenge for law-makers is to make legal processes and instruments more adaptive and responsive to change itself.

These two climate models are used to force the ArcSWAT model. Subsequently this model is calibrated using SUFI-2 optimization technique. The downscaled and bias-corrected data from an ensemble of 10 climate projections with representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios (five each) were used in first model, whereas in second model a total of 63 (7 perturbed precipitations and 9 perturbed temperatures) combinations of hypothetical climate change scenarios were used. The results show very good correlation during monthly calibration time steps and relatively good agreement between the observed and simulated streamflows in daily calibration time steps. The uncertainties are expressed in probabilistic terms using probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) as they provide significant information for decision process in climate change adaptation in the river basin. The uncertainties associated with climate models, return periods and streamflow extremes are also analysed in the present work. The RCP 8.5 scenarios seem more appropriate than RCP 4.5 scenarios in quantifying the uncertainties under nonstationarity assumptions. The mean values of water balance components and their percentage variation for both historic and future periods reveal that the water balance components get affected significantly due to climate change in a future period. Consequently, the streamflows are likely to decline in the river basin. The present study also highlights the comprehensive approaches that are being planned to facilitate adaptation to climate change as well as those that are specific to the water resources management in the study region. The findings in this work are useful for overall well-being of people in the study area.","[Rao, Madhusudana C.; Bardhan, A.] Natl Inst Technol Jamshedpur, Dept Civil Engn, Jamshedpur 831014, Bihar, India",National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Jamshedpur,"Rao, CM (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol Jamshedpur, Dept Civil Engn, Jamshedpur 831014, Bihar, India.",madhu_chintalacheruvu@yahoo.co.in,"Bardhan, Avijit/AAZ-1927-2020; Rao, Chintalacheruvu Madhusudana/AAB-6257-2019","Rao, Chintalacheruvu Madhusudana/0000-0001-6696-8098; Bardhan, Avijit/0000-0003-4196-380X",,,,,71,0,0,0,1,GLOBAL NETWORK ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,ATHENS,"30 VOULGAROKTONOU STR, ATHENS, GR 114 72, GREECE",1790-7632,,,GLOBAL NEST J,Glob.

In Bangladesh, community-based adaptation (CBA) practitioners are critical for facilitating communication among global, national and local scales. They can also take responsibility for finding appropriate channels through which to share relevant information. Interviews with CBA practitioners examine how knowledge is gained and transmitted between practitioners and other CCA stakeholders, focusing on the challenges experienced. These challenges represent friction in knowledge transmittal. Key to lubricating smooth knowledge flows is an understanding of the specific contexts within which knowledge is to be exchanged. At the professional level, multidisciplinary knowledge must be made accessible through provision of widely comprehensible content shared in an appropriate format. At the local level, understandings of trust, priorities and power relations are vital for ensuring relevance in the knowledge shared by professional stakeholders.

A Delphi study was conducted, using a panel of experts, to determine the major risks and opportunities for tourism in the region as well as appropriate adaptation options. Although many of the findings focused on the best way to manage the negative bio-physical impacts of climate change, such as increased bushfire risk or more frequent and intense storms, several opportunities also became apparent including the potential to reduce seasonality. Tourism destination management is already a complex area and the introduction of climate change provides yet another challenge for managers and policy-makers.

The natural insurance value of soil biodiversity mostly depends on farmed risk preferences as well as on the frequency of drought events to be insured against. We show that when the probability of drought increases, soil biodiversity conservation can be an optimal ecosystem-based adaptation strategy. However, this is only likely to be the case up to a given drought probability threshold.

In a Swedish context, this has meant a predominant focus on risks of flooding, erosion and sea-level rise. Gradually, regulatory mechanisms and concrete strategies are evolving to support practical mainstreaming. The aim of this paper was to analyze how frontline planners approach climate change adaptation in an urban context, emphasizing the process of settling and enacting strategic guidelines in spatial planning. The study suggests that municipalities are being preactive, i.e., preparing to act by settling guidelines rather than proactively implementing change when planning for new settlements. Further, the process of accommodating climate risks involves problems. Settling strategic guidelines and determining appropriate levels for what to adapt to are but the start of approaching climate change. Guidelines represent more of an endeavor than settling absolute limits and actually applying the guidelines involves challenges of accessibility and esthetics where the new waterfront limits meets older city structures. Further, guidelines are seen as negotiable since an overarching principle is to maintain flexibility in planning to allow for continued waterfront planning. Pursuing this path is motivated by current demand and previous urban settlement patterns. Also, as future protective measures are needed to secure existing urban areas at risk of flooding and erosion, planners see no use in preventing further waterfront development. Although settling guidelines are important in preparing to act, their practical effectiveness all fall back to how they are actually implemented in daily planning. This leads us to problematize the role of strategic guidelines to secure a climate-proof spatial planning.","[Storbjork, Sofie] Linkoping Univ, Dept Environm Change, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res CSPR, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Uggla, Ylva] Univ Orebro, Ctr Urban & Reg Studies CUReS, S-70182 Orebro, Sweden",Linkoping University; Orebro University,"Storbjork, S (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Environm Change, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res CSPR, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",sofie.storbjork@liu.se; ylva.uggla@oru.se,,,"Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS) [214-2006-146]; Department of Environmental Change at Linkoping University; FORMAS research project CLIPP Climate change policy integration in local policy and planning [242-2011-1599]","Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS)(Swedish Research Council Formas); Department of Environmental Change at Linkoping University; FORMAS research project CLIPP Climate change policy integration in local policy and planning","The authors thank the interviewed planners for generously sharing their views, perspectives and experiences of working with climate adaptation in spatial planning.

Data were collected using structured questionnaire and interview schedule and analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistical tools. Findings showed that majority were females (67%), married (92%) and maintain average household size of 6 persons and a mean age of 51 years. They were mainly primary (32%) and secondary (34%) school certificate holders with farming (77%) as their major occupation. The major cropping pattern practiced was mixed farming with cassava (63%) and maize (58%) as the major crops cultivated by the farmers. Majority of the farmers owned farms of one hectare and below accessed mainly through inheritance (76%) and labour sourced mainly through hiring (50%). Most (81%) of the farmers have spent more than ten years in farming. Climate change information was accessed mainly through their personal experience (64%), radio (42%) and fellow villagers (39%). The study identified eight major challenges faced by cocoyam farmers in adapting to climate change namely Lack/high cost of farm inputs and low soil fertility (Factor 1), Land and labour constraints (Factor 2), Poor access to information and ineffectiveness of cooperatives (Factor 3), lack of/poor access to fund and credit facilities and poor government support (Factor 4), lack of improved varieties of cocoyam (factor 5), poor value attached to cocoyam (Factor 6), poor infrastructural capacity and technology know-how (Factor 7) and Transportation constraint (Factor 8). Analysis of variance identified significant variations in the challenges faced by cocoyam farmers in the study area. The study recommends enrollment in cooperatives and revitalizing existing cooperatives, re-orientation of farmers on the benefits of cocoyam and increased used of climate change information sharing using mobile phones as possible ways of alleviating the challenges.

However, there has been little critical analysis into the underwriting and governance mechanisms necessary support broader scaled application. Through surveying recent literature, this article offers conceptual clarity for understanding emerging adaptation finance mechanisms that intersect with urban governance, planning, and management functions. The article assesses two key conceptual domains: (i) the distinction between adaptation funding and financing and (ii) the synergies, conflicts, and trade-offs associated with mobilizing adaptation investments in the private sector. The article argues that a clearer delineation of these two domains will clarify the objectives, mechanisms, and larger governance implications of investment in urban adaptation. This article provides a roadmap for future scholarly inquiries that may advance the conceptual and analytical discipline necessary to evaluate the feasibility and desirability of investments from often-conflicting perspectives, interests, and actors.","[Keenan, Jesse M.] Harvard Univ, Fac Architecture, Grad Sch Design, 407 Gund Hall,48 Quincy St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chu, Eric] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Peterson, Jacqueline] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada",Harvard University; University of Birmingham; University of Toronto,"Keenan, JM (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Fac Architecture, Grad Sch Design, 407 Gund Hall,48 Quincy St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jkeenan@gsd.harvard.edu,"Chu, Eric/O-6464-2015","Chu, Eric/0000-0002-5648-6615; Keenan, Jesse/0000-0003-4058-1682; Peterson, Jacqueline/0000-0002-2018-2353",,,,,69,7,7,3,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1946-3138,1946-3146,,INT J URBAN SUSTAIN,Int.

Herein we describe three case studies of trout stream adaptation that address existing and climate-driven causes of degradation through habitat restoration. The case studies vary in geography and complexity, but all include restoration efforts intended to address multiple causes of stream degradation and improve the resilience of these streams to floods, droughts, and wildfires. Four elements of successful climate adaptation projects emerge: (1) habitat assessments that help drive project location and design, (2) projects that directly address climate change impacts and increase habitat resilience, (3) projects that combine to achieve watershed-scale impacts, and (4) projects that include sufficient monitoring to determine their effectiveness. We describe solutions to common challenges in conducting climate change adaptation, including how to balance scientific assessments with opportunities when choosing projects, how smaller projects can be aggregated to achieve watershed-scale benefits, and how citizen science efforts can augment monitoring programs. El cambio climatico esta contribuyendo a incrementar la severidad y la tasa de degradacion de los rios a traves de la alteracion en la estacionalidad del flujo maximo, modificacion del regimen de flujos, generacion de perturbaciones mas frecuentes e intensas e incremento de la temperatura de los rios. Aqui se describen tres casos de estudio de la adaptacion de rios en donde habita la trucha, en los que se abordan las causas de la degradacion que son provocadas por el cambio climatico, mediante la restauracion del habitat. Los casos de estudio varian en cuanto a ubicacion geografica y complejidad, pero en todos se contemplan esfuerzos de restauracion enfocados a abordar multiples causas de degradacion de rios y mejoramiento de la resiliencia de estos ante inundaciones, sequias e incendios naturales. Se consideraron cuatro elementos para lograr una adaptacion exitosa al cambio climatico: 1) evaluaciones del habitat que ayuden a disenar y establecer donde llevar a cabo los proyectos; 2) proyectos que aborden directamente los impactos del cambio climatico y el incremento en la resiliencia del habitat; 3) proyectos que, al combinarse, logren resultados a nivel de cuenca hidrologica; y 4) proyectos que incluyan un monitoreo suficiente como para que se pueda determinar su efectividad. Tambien se describen soluciones a los clasicos retos que implica la adaptacion al cambio climatico, incluyendo como encontrar un balance entre evaluaciones cientificas y eleccion de proyectos, como se pueden integrar varios proyectos pequenos para conseguir beneficios a escala de cuenca y como se puede incrementar el monitoreo mediante esfuerzos ciudadanos.","[Williams, Jack E.] Trout Unltd, Medford, OR 97501 USA; [Neville, Helen M.; Haak, Amy L.] Trout Unltd, Boise, ID USA; [Colyer, Warren T.] Trout Unltd, Missoula, MT USA; [Wenger, Seth J.] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Bradshaw, Stan] Trout Unltd, Helena, MT USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Williams, JE (corresponding author), Trout Unltd, 4393 Pioneer Rd, Medford, OR 97501 USA.",jwilliams@tu.org,,,National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; BLM; Trout Unlimited (TU); Western Native Trout Initiative; Ruby Pipeline Endangered Species Conservation Fund; Barrick Goldstrike Mines Inc.; Nevada Mining Association; Maggie Creek; Twenty-Five Ranches; U.S. Forest Service; National Forest Foundation; Idaho Department of Environmental Quality; TU; Simplot Corporation; TU's Coldwater Conservation Fund,National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; BLM; Trout Unlimited (TU); Western Native Trout Initiative; Ruby Pipeline Endangered Species Conservation Fund; Barrick Goldstrike Mines Inc.; Nevada Mining Association; Maggie Creek; Twenty-Five Ranches; U.S. Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); National Forest Foundation; Idaho Department of Environmental Quality; TU; Simplot Corporation; TU's Coldwater Conservation Fund,"Funding was provided by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, BLM, Trout Unlimited (TU), the Western Native Trout Initiative, the Ruby Pipeline Endangered Species Conservation Fund, Barrick Goldstrike Mines Inc., and Nevada Mining Association, with support from the Maggie Creek and Twenty-Five Ranches.

Using 761 household interviews and 33 focus group discussions (FGDs) with smallholder farmers from six districts, data was collected on how smallholder farmers in the region experience climate change, what CA practices they had adopted, and benefits and challenges associated with CA practice. Results show that men and women farmers had similar experiences of climate change, namely late onset of a shortened rainy season, intra-seasonal drought and higher temperatures. Farmers' perceptions of gender-mediated effects of climate change had important nuances. The three most cited effects of climate change on women mentioned by women were lower crop yields, outbreaks of armyworms and reduced livestock fodder. The men thought women were most affected by increased hunger, lower crop yields and reduced domestic water sources. According to the women FGDs, men were most affected through reduced crop yields, increases in livestock diseases and increased hunger. The men self-reported reduced crop yields, reduced water for livestock and outbreaks of armyworms. Both men and women saw CA as having climate change adaptation benefits. For the women, men most benefitted from CA through the high moisture holding capacity of basins, higher crop yields and reduced labor requirements through use of oxen ripping. The men most appreciated the high crop yields, improved soil fertility and reduced costs as less fertilizer is used. The women cited the high moisture holding capacity of basins, high crop yields and improved soil fertility as benefits they most commonly derived from CA, while the men thought the women most benefitted from CA through the higher crop yields, improved soil fertility and crop tolerance to droughts. The study concludes that there is room for CA to serve as a climate smart agricultural system for both men and women smallholder farmers in Eastern Zambia. However, this will require addressing important challenges of high weed pressure, high labor demands, and low access to manure, and CA farming implements. The CA package for Zambia should include access to timely climate information and climate informed crop choices.","[Umar, Bridget Bwalya] Nordic Africa Inst, Uppsala, Sweden; [Umar, Bridget Bwalya] Univ Zambia, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Lusaka, Zambia",University of Zambia,"Umar, BB (corresponding author), Nordic Africa Inst, Uppsala, Sweden.;Umar, BB (corresponding author), Univ Zambia, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Lusaka, Zambia.",brigt2001@yahoo.co.uk,"Bwalya Umar, Bridget/X-7887-2019","Bwalya Umar, Bridget/0000-0003-3655-2248",World Bank Group; Nordic Africa Institute; TerrAfrica,World Bank Group; Nordic Africa Institute; TerrAfrica,The fieldwork was funded by the World Bank Group and TerrAfrica through the study on traditional constraints and less traditional or behavioral constraints for women participation in Agricultural and Forest Management in Zambia.

This study presents a novel framework for adaptation trade-off assessments, which integrates (I) two trade-off mechanisms (direct and interactions) and (II) two types of trade-off characteristics (substantive and processual). Perspectives on adaptation trade-offs were collected from 37 Swedish and Finnish agricultural experts through semi-structured interviews supported by serious gaming and visualization. The data were thematically analysed based on the provided analytical framework. The results show that trade-offs in agricultural adaptation decision-making processes involve balancing a number of socio-ecological system aspects that are of different character and have different functions. The study identified 20 aspects generating trade-offs related to adaptation management in Swedish and Finnish agriculture, among which 'crop yield and profitability', 'farm economy', 'pest and weed robustness' and 'soil quality' were discussed as the most prominent by respondents. The framework enables an examination of complex trade-off structures that can have implications for adaptation management decisions. The results show that the identified aspects constitute different components and functions of trade-offs, including both processual and/or substantive ones. In conclusion, the 20 identified aspects and the framework together demonstrate the importance of the two types of adaptation trade-offs and the resulting complexity of climate change adaptation decision-making in Swedish and Finnish agriculture. Furthermore, the study asserts the potential of applying the framework for various strategic contexts-to recognize and cope with trade-offs in adaptation management.","[Wirehn, Lotten; Neset, Tina-Simone; Juhola, Sirkku] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Linkoping, Sweden; [Kayhko, Janina; Juhola, Sirkku] Univ Helsinki, Ecosyst & Environm Res Programme, Helsinki, Finland",Linkoping University; University of Helsinki,"Wirehn, L (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Linkoping, Sweden.",lotten.wirehn@liu.se; janina.kayhko@helsinki.fi; tina.neset@liu.se; sirkku.juhola@helsinki.fi,"Käyhkö, Janina/AAW-6163-2021; Juhola, Sirkku/GVS-5485-2022","Käyhkö, Janina/0000-0003-0904-5857; Juhola, Sirkku/0000-0003-0095-2282; Wirehn, Lotten/0000-0003-4014-1441",Linkoping University - Swedish Research Council FORMAS [2013-1557],Linkoping University - Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas),Open access funding provided by Linkoping University.

It assumes that a pastoral community is a coherent unit, an assumption that does not adequately capture the increasingly differentiated adaptation path-ways. Analyzing key adaptation practices among Maasai (agro-) pastoralists' of Laikipia County, we outline how wealth, age and gender differentiate actors' adaptation pathways. We argue that adaptation pathways are political processes highly negotiated by these elements of social differentiation and that individual actors adaptation opportunities are substantially shaped by their social positions. Additionally, we make the case for using adaptation practices as focal points for adaptation pathways research because this methodological choice allows unpacking who, why and how questions in the uptake of emerging technical adaptation practices, especially how they are influenced by individual social positions of wealth, age and gender.","[Ng'ang'a, Teresiah Wairimu] Univ Nairobi, Dept Land Resources Management & Agr Technol LARM, Kabete Campus,POB 29053, Nairobi, Kenya; [Ng'ang'a, Teresiah Wairimu] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Landscapes Governance Theme, United Nations Ave,POB 30677-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Crane, Todd A.] Int Livestock Res Inst ILRI, Sustainable Livestock Syst, POB 30709-00100, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Nairobi; CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF); CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Ng'ang'a, TW (corresponding author), Univ Nairobi, Dept Land Resources Management & Agr Technol LARM, Kabete Campus,POB 29053, Nairobi, Kenya.;Ng'ang'a, TW (corresponding author), World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Landscapes Governance Theme, United Nations Ave,POB 30677-00100, Nairobi, Kenya.",T.Nganga@cgiar.org,,,USAID [3106 USAD1133A.01AN GBL075]; Germany Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) [3106 DAAD-1157G.03A0 GBL075],USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Germany Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"This research is based on work done as a part of the Local Governance for Adaptation to Climate Change (LGACC) project, implemented by the International Livestock Research Institute together with World Agroforestry Centre with funding from USAID (3106 USAD1133A.01AN GBL075) in a collaborative PhD program with Germany Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) (3106 DAAD-1157G.03A0 GBL075).

A study was conducted to analyze smallholder maize farmers' perception of climate change/variability and identify their adaptation approaches and barriers for adaptation in the eastern highlands of Ethiopia. Meteorological data were assessed to provide evidence of the perceived change. A survey was conducted in six major maize-producing kebeles with a total of 364 respondents. A multi-stage sampling method was employed for selecting the sample units for the study. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and a multinomial logit model. The results indicated that 78% of the sampled smallholder maize farmers perceived increasing temperatures while 83% perceived decreasing amounts of rainfall. About 75% of the farmers indicated that they became aware of climate change and variability from their own experience and perceived deforestation as the main cause. The farmers perceived that drought, diseases and pests, dwindling soil fertility, and declining crop yields were the major impacts of climate change that affected maize production. The farmers' major adaptation practices include adjusting planting dates, using improved maize varieties, intercropping, recommended mineral fertilizers, supplementary irrigation, and soil and water conservation measures. Econometric analysis revealed that low educational level, shortage of land, large family sizes, age, lack of access to irrigation water, lack of access to credit, and lack of access to extension services were the most important barriers to climate change adaptation in the area. It is concluded that farmers cultivating maize in the study area have perceived climate change and use certain adaptation strategies to counter its negative impacts on maize production. This implies that policies should be geared towards strengthening farmers' efforts to adapt to climate change and alleviate the existing barriers in promoting adaptation strategies for enhancing the productivity of maize.","[Teshome, Helen] Haramaya Univ, Africa Ctr Excellence Climate Smart Agr & Biodive, POB 138, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia; [Tesfaye, Kindie] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Dechassa, Nigussie] Haramaya Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Sch Plant Sci, POB 138, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia; [Tana, Tamado] Univ Eswatini, Fac Agr, Dept Crop Prod, PO Luyengo M205, Kwaluseni, Eswatini; [Huber, Matthew] Purdue Univ, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Haramaya University; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); Haramaya University; Purdue University System; Purdue University,"Teshome, H (corresponding author), Haramaya Univ, Africa Ctr Excellence Climate Smart Agr & Biodive, POB 138, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia.",helenteshome20@yahoo.com; k.tesfayefantaye@cgiar.org; nigussiedachassa@gmail.com; tamado63@yahoo.com; huberm@purdue.edu,"Huber, Matthew/A-7677-2008; Robi, Nigussie Dechassa/AAB-5633-2022","Huber, Matthew/0000-0002-2771-9977; Dechassa, Nigussie/0000-0001-5980-4773; Tesfaye, Kindie/0000-0002-7201-8053","Africa Center of Excellence for Climate Smart Agriculture and Biodiversity Conservation, Haramaya University","Africa Center of Excellence for Climate Smart Agriculture and Biodiversity Conservation, Haramaya University","Africa Center of Excellence for Climate Smart Agriculture and Biodiversity Conservation, Haramaya University, Ethiopiaas part of a research study.",,84,8,8,6,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2021,13,17,,,,,,,9622,10.3390/su13179622,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13179622,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UO1VF,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000694488900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To recognise the extent to which green infrastructure and nature-based solutions (NbS) are present in the urban policy, we conducted a review of planning, strategic and programming documents of Poznan City as a Case Study. The study is aimed at 1) diagnosing of current position NbS in the tasks and directions of planning, strategic and programming documents; 2) characteristic of activities related to NbS according to the form of human-nature interaction; 3) determining the potential of including NbS in the local policy; 4) identifying the role of NbS in facing 4 main challenges in urban policy: resilience and climate change adaptation, health and well-being, social cohesion, economic development potential. The results show that a significant number of actions focus on GI changes towards its multifunctionality and better quality, while there are not many actions towards supporting citizens in using it. Also, despite urban pressure, new green spaces are still planned to be created. The role of NbS within GI in urban resilience is well recognised. Yet, the adaptation to climate change has gained a low priority so far. Linkages between GI and the wellbeing of inhabitants are well understood. However, the possibility to build and strengthen social cohesion based on GI is rather marginally noticed. The least recognised is the influence of NbS on the economic development potential. It is an area that still needs to be investigated to bring evidence in this field. We conclude that to support large-scale, nature-based solution implementation in cities, the crucial step is to bring them into the local urban agenda. An evaluation of urban policy documents based on the presented approach can serve as a guideline for identifying gaps and potentials for NbS inclusion.

Therefore, this paper respectively constructed evaluation indicators for urban sprawl sustainability (USS) and climate change adaptability (CCA). Next, a coupling coordination degree model was used to measure the coordinated development of USS and CCA. Finally, this paper analyzed the coordinated development type of USS and CCA in the Chongqing metropolitan area from 2007 to 2017. The results of this paper show that USS and CCA have gradually shifted to coordinated development in the Chongqing metropolitan area during the study period. However, there were obvious regional differences in the type of coordinated development in the Chongqing metropolitan area. The coordinated development degree of USS and CCA in nine districts ranged from 0.635 to 0.721 in 2017. It can be divided into three types: slightly coordinated development with lagging CCA; slightly coordinated development with lagging USS; and moderately coordinated development with lagging CCA. Those districts should give priority to the use of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS), and multi-center and multi-group approaches to enhance the coordinated development between USS and CCA, which is also helpful for mountainous cities in China and other countries.","[Wang, Yiming; Xiang, Pengcheng] Chongqing Univ, Sch Construct Management & Real Estate, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China; [Xiang, Pengcheng] Chongqing Univ, Int Res Ctr Sustainable Built Environm, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China",Chongqing University; Chongqing University,"Xiang, PC (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Sch Construct Management & Real Estate, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China.;Xiang, PC (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Int Res Ctr Sustainable Built Environm, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China.",yimingwang@cqu.edu.cn; pcxiang@cqu.edu.cn,,,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017CDJSK03XK19, 2018CDXYJG0047]; Social Science Planning Projects in Chongqing, China [2018ZD02]","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Social Science Planning Projects in Chongqing, China","This study was supported by a joint grant from Project No. 2017CDJSK03XK19, 2018CDXYJG0047 supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, and Project No. 2018ZD02 supported by the Social Science Planning Projects in Chongqing, China.",,57,6,6,4,33,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN 1,2019,11,1,,,,,,,20,10.3390/su11010020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11010020,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HJ4ER,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000457127300020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Having relied on these relatively stable reserves for crop irrigation for centuries, today's high-Himalayan farmers must now contend with irregular weather patterns and events, such as drought, mudslides and cloudbursts. In the face of this shifting landscape, many farming villages have responded by altering long-standing agricultural practices in an effort to adapt to a changing climate. In this context, the incorporation of frozen landscape infrastructures can help to control the flow of surface meltwater, direct valuable water resources and stockpile irrigation reserves in the form of ice and snow. This article describes three types of frozen landscape design interventions currently employed in northern India: artificial glaciers, ice stupas and snow barrier bands. Although these constructs have been designed by engineers rather than landscape architects, they contribute to a larger body of climate-adaptive design solutions that suggest a way forward in the face of the unstable environmental pressures of the future. As landscape architects and designers look for opportunities to intervene in the climate crisis, the nascent frozen landscapes of northern India present ideas for climate change adaptive design work to build upon.","[Clouse, Carey] Univ Massachusetts, Architecture & Landscape Architecture, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Clouse, C (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Architecture & Landscape Architecture, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",clouse@larp.umass.edu,,,US Department of State under Fulbright-Nehru FLEX Senior Researcher Award; Jasper and Marion Whiting Foundation,US Department of State under Fulbright-Nehru FLEX Senior Researcher Award; Jasper and Marion Whiting Foundation,This work was supported by the US Department of State under a 2014-2015 Fulbright-Nehru FLEX Senior Researcher Award and the Jasper and Marion Whiting Foundation.,,44,7,7,4,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-6397,1469-9710,,LANDSCAPE RES,Landsc.

An enhanced albedo of the urban surfaces leads to the highest cooling ability with a significant daily average cooling of 0.2 K per 0.1 increase of albedo, while green roofs have only a small cooling effect at pedestrian level. An increased vertical compactness has a cooling ability due to the higher amount of shading, enhanced horizontal compactness shows a negative impact on the micro climate due to the raised percentage of sealed surfaces and the additional urban structures that can emit additional heat during the night.

Thus, examining extreme daily precipitation and temperature in the context of climate change is a critical factor in advocating climate change adaptation at the local scales. Spatial changes of climate indices for extreme precipitation and temperatures were conducted for the period 1986-2016 in three different agroecologies of the Gurage zone, Southern Ethiopia. The study used the Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Sen's slope estimator to estimate the trend and magnitude of changes in precipitation and temperature. The analysis from the observation indicates that there had been a consistent warming trend and inconsistent changes in precipitation extremes in the study agroecologies. A statistically significant increase in the numbers of warm days and nights and a statistically significant reduction in the numbers of cold days and nights were observed in most of the agroecologies. The duration of extreme trend showed inconsistency; however, a drier condition is observed in lowland agroecology. Therefore, based on the findings of this study, appropriate climate adaptation efforts are needed at the local scale.","[Dendir, Zelalem] Madda Walabu Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resource, Bale Robe, Ethiopia; [Birhanu, Belay Simane] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Ctr Environm & Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Dendir, Z (corresponding author), Madda Walabu Univ, Coll Agr & Nat Resource, Bale Robe, Ethiopia.",zelalemdendir@gmail.com; simaneb@yahoo.com,,"Simane, Belay/0000-0002-8004-3486",,,,,41,0,0,0,0,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-9309,1687-9317,,ADV METEOROL,Adv.

The aim of this study was to examine whether adaptation responses are 'robust', by looking at whether they reduce vulnerability to climate and socio-economic changes for a selection of ecosystem services across scenarios and two spatial scales: Europe (EU27 plus Norway and Switzerland) and a case study in Scotland. Outputs of the CLIMSAVE Integrated Assessment Platform (IAP) for multiple land-based sectors were used to test whether clusters of adaptation options referred to as policy archetypes reduced vulnerability to climate and socio-economic change for ecosystem service indicators related to biodiversity, flooding, water exploitation, land use diversity, land use intensity and food provision. The results show that the People-based Adaptation archetype is the most robust. This is because it reduces vulnerability by increasing coping capacity (people learn and build networks) and not only by reducing the impacts of climate and socio-economic change. By allowing comparative levels of vulnerability to be explored across sectors and scenarios, the CLIMSAVE approach provides a flexible tool for decision-makers and other stakeholders to increase understanding of which mixes of adaptation measures are robust responses to climate change.","[Jager, J.; Omann, I.; Kammerlander, M.] Sustainable Europe Res Inst, Garnisongasse 7, Vienna, Austria; [Rounsevell, M.

The study data were obtained from in-depth interviews with institutional heads from water resources management and emergency management and a review of secondary literature from databases such as Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science. The results show that inadequate hydrological data management, low awareness on how to adapt among the public and decision-makers, financial constraints, no political will to pass important bills into law, and inadequate institutional and legal framework are the main institutional barriers of adaptation to climate change in Nigeria. The study concludes that it is essential to strengthen the institutional and legal system, information management mechanism, public awareness, and participatory water resources management.

We use local people's experiences with environmental challenges to illustrate limitations of the climate change adaptation paradigm, and offer the additional concept of community work - analogous to niche construction - as a counterpart to the adaptive process at the community level. Whereas climate change adaptation insinuates active and purposive change, the reality we have repeatedly encountered is that people in these communities focus not on changing but on building and maintaining capacity and achieving stability: keeping aging and overtaxed infrastructure running while also working toward improving quality of life and services in their communities. We discuss how these findings are congruent with recent calls to better situate climate change adaptation policy in the context of community development, and argue that scientists and policymakers need to understand this context of community work to avoid the pitfalls that potentially accompany the adaptation paradigm.","[Loring, Philip A.] Univ Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Gerlach, S.

Overall, China's action to adapt to climate change remains in its infancy, and relevant research needs to be further deepened. In this paper, we study the future adaptive countermeasures of Shenzhen city in the Pearl River Delta in terms of climate change, especially urban flood risk resilience. Based on the background investigation of urban flood risk in Shenzhen, this paper calculates the annual precipitation frequency of Shenzhen from 1953 to 2020, and uses the extreme precipitation index as a quantitative indicator to analyze the changes in historical precipitation and the impact of major flood disasters in Shenzhen city in previous decades. Based on the six kinds of model data of the scenario Model Inter-comparison Project (MIP) in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP6), uses the Taylor diagram and MR comprehensive evaluation method to evaluate the ability of different climate models to simulate extreme precipitation in Shenzhen, and the selected models are aggregated and averaged to predict the climate change trend of Shenzhen from 2020 to 2100. The prediction results show that Shenzhen will face more severe threats from rainstorms and floods in the future. Therefore, this paper proposes a resilience strategy for the city to cope with the threat of flood in the future, including constructing a smart water management system and promoting the development of a sponge city. Moreover, to a certain extent, it is necessary to realize risk transfer by promoting a flood insurance system.","[Shao, Weiwei; Su, Xin; Liu, Jiahong; Yang, Zhiyong; Mei, Chao; Liu, Chuang; Lu, Jiahui] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Lu, Jie] Liaoning Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Dalian 116029, Peoples R China",China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research; Liaoning Normal University,"Liu, JH (corresponding author), China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.",shaoww@iwhr.com; suxin199109@gmail.com; lj895232175@gmail.com; liujh@iwhr.com; yangzy@iwhr.com; meichao@iwhr.com; liuchuang1619@gmail.com; lujiahui1215@gmail.com,"Liu, Jiahong/AAG-1319-2021","Shao, weiwei/0000-0002-4421-6781","Chinese National Key Research and Development Program [2018YFC1508203]; Chinese National Natural Science Foundation [51979285, 51739011, 51879274]; GIZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit); SDC (Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation)",Chinese National Key Research and Development Program; Chinese National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); GIZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit); SDC (Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation),"The researchers would like to extend their thanks to the Chinese National Key Research and Development Program (2018YFC1508203) and Chinese National Natural Science Foundation (Nos. 51979285, 51739011 and 51879274).

This paper presents the results of a study that evaluates capacity in relation to the health and water sectors in Vietnam. The study presents informants' views on the adequacy of financial resources, understanding of vulnerability and adaptation, training needs, information requirements and levels of cooperation as well as their priorities to address adaptation. The perceptions of respondents on challenges and obstacles faced in developing adaptation strategies are also examined. Training on vulnerability and increasing funds for adaptation were reported as the top priorities, indicating that the inadequacy of human and financial resources is the most significant challenge to effective adaptation in the study context.

The paper concludes that there are significant interconnected constraints on adaptive capacity in Vietnam that are further exacerbated by governance issues, such as inadequate cooperation and transparency in sharing information and data.

Design/methodology/approach Based on an empirical analytical method, this paper examines interviews conducted with senior managers of leading companies located in Brazil to identify their perceptions of adopting strategic actions toward mitigating and adapting to climate change. Findings The key results are as follows: the most commonly perceived long-term benefit was operational improvement, based on the improved energy efficiency of operations; strategic management of aspects affected by climate change can make managers more aware of the benefits derived from the decisions taken; and a short-term view and aversion to uncertainty can lead to failures in strategic management, limiting the effectiveness of actions for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Originality/value This paper contributes to the literature on the topic of climate change by presenting evidence that adaptation and mitigation measures can increase organizational managers' perception of long-term benefits, and that climate change management structures guide managers to make the transition to a low-carbon economy.","[Furlan Alves, Marcelo Berbone] Fed Univ South Mato Grosso UFMS, Prod Engn Dept, Nova Andradina, Brazil; [Lopes de Sousa Jabbour, Ana Beatriz] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France; [Mariano, Enzo Barberio] UNESP Sao Paulo State Univ, Bauru, Brazil",Montpellier Business School; Universidade Estadual Paulista,"Jabbour, ABLD (corresponding author), Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France.",a.sousa-jabbour@montpellier-bs.com,"Mariano, Enzo/AAQ-5890-2021; Furlan, Marcelo/AAO-9134-2020; Furlan, Marcelo/GPX-8178-2022; Lopes de Sousa Jabbour, Ana Beatriz/B-8966-2012; Mariano, Enzo B/J-6875-2012","Mariano, Enzo/0000-0002-9577-3297; Furlan, Marcelo/0000-0001-7930-1997; Lopes de Sousa Jabbour, Ana Beatriz/0000-0001-6423-8868; Mariano, Enzo B/0000-0002-9577-3297",,,,,69,7,7,5,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0953-4814,1758-7816,,J ORGAN CHANGE MANAG,J.

An assessment was undertaken through a comprehensive literature review. Understanding the underlying causes of regional food insecurity inevitably means understanding the role of the AIDS epidemic and increasingly climate change amongst other stressors. AIDS cuts through household and community level capacity, as well as the capacity of key facilitators of the adaptation process including state extension services and civil society organisations. The main argument of the paper is that adaptation to climate change must explicitly factor in the existing and long-term effects of the epidemic. While calls for embracing adaptation abound, little is being done to assess and strengthen the organisational capacity of institutions, which should play leading roles in any attempt to help prepare for a changing climate. In particular the capacity of key agencies has been undermined by the AIDS epidemic. This reiterates the need for a multisectoral approach and building bridges between agriculture and health sectors to ensure longer term support to livelihoods where HIV and hunger coexist, often overlaid by climate change.

It points out a set of conjuncture factors that allow us to foresee a new paradigm of sustainable development for the region by transforming the sun's radiant energy into electricity through distributed photovoltaic generation. The new paradigm, as presented in this essay, has the transformative potential to free the region from past regional development dogma, which was dependent on the scarce water resource, and the marginal and predatory use of its Caatinga Biome. Design/methodology/approach - The research uses a pre ante design, following the procedures of scenario building, as an adaptation mechanism to climate change in the sector of energy generation and socioeconomic inclusion. Findings - The scenarios of socioeconomic resilience to climate change based on the abundance of solar radiation, rather than the scarcity of water, demonstrates its potential as a global adaptation paradigm to climate change. Research limitations/implications - The developments proposed are dependent on federal legislation changes, allowing the small producer to be remunerated by the energy produced. Practical implications - The proposed smart grid photovoltaic generation program increases the country's resiliency to the effect of droughts and climate change. Social implications - As proposed, the program allows for the reversion of a pattern of long term poverty in semi-arid Northeast Brazil. Originality/value - The exploitation of the characteristics of abundance of the semiarid climate, i.e. its very condition of semi-aridity with abundant solar radiation, is itself an advantage factor toward adaption to unforeseen drought events. Extensive previous research has focused on weighting and monitoring drought i.e. the paradigm of scarcity. The interplay between exploiting Northeast Brazil's abundant factors and climate change adaptation, especially at the small farmer levels constitutes a discovery never before contemplated.","[Nobre, Paulo] INPE, Natl Inst Space Res, CPTEC, Ctr Weather Forecast & Climate Studies, Cachoeira Paulista, Brazil; [Pereira, Enio Bueno] INPE, Natl Inst Space Res, CCST, Earth Syst Sci Ctr, Sao Jose Dos Campos, Brazil; [Lacerda, Francinete Francis] IPA, Agron Inst Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Bursztyn, Marcel] Univ Brasilia, CDS, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Haddad, Eduardo Amaral] Univ Sao Paulo, FEA, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Ley, Debora] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England",Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE); Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE); Universidade de Brasilia; Universidade de Sao Paulo; University of Oxford,"Nobre, P (corresponding author), INPE, Natl Inst Space Res, CPTEC, Ctr Weather Forecast & Climate Studies, Cachoeira Paulista, Brazil.",paulo.nobre@inpe.br,"Haddad, Eduardo/H-2762-2012; Bursztyn, Marcel/F-9921-2012; Nobre, Paulo/AAC-1831-2020; Pereira, Enio/AAH-3308-2020","Haddad, Eduardo/0000-0001-6564-6716; Pereira, Enio/0000-0002-5095-0085","Ministerio da Ciencia, Tecnologia e Inovacao; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico [302218/2016-5, 305137/2014-0, 490237/2011-8]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior [23038.003962/2016-64]; Ministerio da Ciencia, Tecnologia e Inovacao, Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos [01.12.0183.00]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo [2009/50528-6]; Rede CLIMA [01.13.0353.00]; INCT-MC2 [CAPES 16/2014, CNPq 465501/2014-1, FAPESP 2014/50848-9]","Ministerio da Ciencia, Tecnologia e Inovacao; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Ministerio da Ciencia, Tecnologia e Inovacao, Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Rede CLIMA; INCT-MC2","This research was supported by: Ministerio da Ciencia, Tecnologia e InovacAo.

Since the development literature has firmly established the role of weather risk as a source of income volatility for the poor, and climate change is expected to increase this risk, we review the range of risk-coping mechanisms available to poorer households, with a focus on possible barriers to adaptation. We ask both how government interventions affect the set of options available for adaptation and risk coping, and also what these adaptive responses imply for the prospects of sustainable development. Support for adaptation can involve efforts to make existing locations, livelihoods and forms of production more resilient to climate risk (in-situ adaptation), or reductions in vulnerability through the geographical and sectoral mobility of the poor (transformational adaptation). Our review shows how successful adaptation will need to strike a balance between the two forms of adaptation, avoiding locking-in unsustainable practices in locations that are already marginal from an economic perspective, and taking account of broader socioeconomic trends already taking place in many developing countries (such as population growth and urbanisation). We also highlight important considerations for policy-makers, which to date have been relatively neglected in the literature, in particular related to the dynamic interaction between adaptation and sustainable development.

It often assumes that barriers are by and large distinct from limits to adaptation. We respond to recent calls for comparative studies that are able to further knowledge about the underlying drivers of barriers and limits to adaptation. We compare six cases from across Australia, including those in alpine areas, rivers, reefs, wetlands, small inland communities, and islands, with the aim of identifying common underlying drivers of barriers and limits to adaptation. We find that the path-dependent nature of the institutions that govern natural resources and public goods is a deep driver of barriers and limits to adaptation. Path-dependent institutions are resistant to change. When this resistance causes the changes necessary for adaptation to be slower than changes in climate, then it becomes a limit to adaptation.","[Barnett, Jon] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Evans, Louisa S.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Geog, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England; [Evans, Louisa S.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Gross, Catherine] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Kiem, Anthony S.] Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Kingsford, Richard T.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Palutikof, Jean P.] Griffith Univ, Natl Climate Change Adaptat Res Facil, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Pickering, Catherine M.] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Smithers, Scott G.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Exeter; James Cook University; Australian National University; University of Newcastle; University of New South Wales Sydney; Griffith University; Griffith University; James Cook University,"Barnett, J (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",,"Kiem, Anthony/D-9307-2013; Barnett, Jon/AAQ-9002-2021","Kiem, Anthony/0000-0002-3994-6958; Barnett, Jon/0000-0002-0862-0808; Smithers, Scott/0000-0002-4420-1897; Pickering, Catherine/0000-0002-3731-5407; Kingsford, Richard/0000-0001-6565-4134; Palutikof, Jean/0000-0002-5248-6925",Australian government through the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility,Australian government through the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility(Australian Government),The studies described in this paper were funded by the Australian government through the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility.,,57,117,117,0,55,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

Most related studies take a national or regional perspective on the impact of climate change. Taiwan is constrained by its geographical conditions, which increase its vulnerability to climate change, especially in its western coastal areas. The county that is most affected by climate change is Yunlin. In 2013-2014, projects that were sponsored by Taiwan's government analyzed the relationship among synthesized vulnerability, ecological footprint (EF) and adaptation to climate change and proposed 15 categories of synthesized vulnerability and EF values. This study further examines the relationship between vulnerability and EF values and examines how residents of four townships-Linnei, Sihu, Mailiao, and Huwei-cope with the effects of climate change. This study investigates whether the residents of the four townships vary in their attitudes to climate change, their perceptions of disaster risk, and their behavioral intentions with respect to coping with climate change. The structural equation model (SEM) is used to examine the relationships among attitudes to climate change, perceptions of disaster risk, and the behavioral intentions of residents in townships with various vulnerabilities to climate change. The results that are obtained using the SEM reveal that climate change mitigation/adaptation behavior is affected by attitudes to climate change and perceptions of disaster risk.

Two distinct methodologies using spatial overlay, have been applied to identify exposure levels of schools in Subansari river basin, where flood events occur annually. In the study, flood conditioning parameters are applied to a large number of schools for the first time. The two methodologies employ seven parameters, namely distance from the stream, elevation, slope, TWI, clay content, groundwater table, and rainfall intensity. The distinction lies in the approaches to determine exposure level based on how the parameters are used in standard practice as per the literature review: parametrically and cumulatively. The findings of the two approaches are compared and recommendations are provided. The study indicates high value of parametric overlay analysis over the cumulative analysis since it identifies granular aspects of exposure and thus allows specific planning and design interventions in and around the schools. Hence,the study assists planners, architects, engineers and policy makers to develop relevant resilient, adaptive school design prototypes and policy in the region. The framework presented through the case study opens opportunity to enhance approaches adopted to reduce the flood risk among schools in the Himalayan region through adaptation, reducing vulnerability and improving capacity through GIS database creation for school going children.","[Mathuria, Shalu] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Ctr Excellence Disaster Mitigat & Management, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Lakra, Harshit Sosan] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Ctr Transportat Syst, Ctr Excellence Disaster Mitigat & Management, Dept Architecture & Planning, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Goswami, Ajanta] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Ctr Excellence Disaster Mitigat & Management, Dept Earth Sci & Joint Fac, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Shaw, Rajib] Keio Univ, Grad Sch Media & Governance, Minato, Tokyo, Japan; [Parihar, Aditi] Maulana Azad Natl Inst Technol, Bhopal, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Roorkee; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Roorkee; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Roorkee; Keio University; National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology Bhopal,"Lakra, HS (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Ctr Excellence Disaster Mitigat & Management, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India.;Lakra, HS (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Architecture & Planning, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India.;Lakra, HS (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Ctr Transportat Syst, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India.",harshit.lakra@ar.iitr.ac.in,"; Goswami, Ajanta/A-3928-2014","Shaw, Rajib/0000-0003-3153-1800; Goswami, Ajanta/0000-0001-9170-8503",,,,,58,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

The Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM) simulates representative crop, beef, or dairy farms over many years of weather to predict performance, economics, and environmental impacts including various emissions and a farm-gate life cycle assessment of carbon, energy, water, and reactive nitrogen footprints of the feed, meat, or milk produced. To illustrate use of the model, a representative dairy farm in central New York was simulated over 25 years of recent historical weather to determine the environmental benefits and economic costs of alternative manure handling strategies. Use of an enclosed manure storage with a flare to burn the methane produced decreased the farm-gate carbon footprint of the milk produced by 20% at an increased annual cost of $42 cow(-1). Using an anaerobic digester to produce gas and electricity used on the farm reduced the carbon footprint by 19% and reduced profitability by $56 cow(-1). The addition of subsurface injection of manure along with a reduction in N fertilizer use greatly reduced ammonia emission from the farm and increased annual profit by $9 cow(-1). Climate change is projected to affect many aspects of dairy production, including growing season length, crop growth processes, harvest timing and losses, cattle performance, nutrient emissions and losses, and ultimately farm profitability. Climate projections for high and low emission scenarios were downscaled from nine general circulation models. IFSM was then used to simulate the same New York dairy farm over 25-year periods using recent, mid-century, and late century climate projected by each of the climate models. Simulations were done without and with adaptation through modified crop varieties and planting and harvest dates. Forage production normally increased with projected climate change and corn grain yields decreased, and together feed production was maintained. Warmer temperatures increased volatile loss of ammonia N, and changes in precipitation patterns increased nutrient runoff losses in surface water. The reactive N footprint of the milk produced was increased by 2% to 11% with the change in climate, but other environmental footprints were relatively unaffected. With appropriate adaptation to climate change, annual farm profitability increased by about $100 cow(-1). However, for the high emission, late century projection, profit decreased by $10 cow(-1) and the risk or annual variance in profit increased by 34%, reflecting greater annual variation in crop and animal productivity. Whole-farm and climate models provide useful tools for studying the benefits and costs of greenhouse gas mitigation and the adaptation of farms to changing climate.","[Rotz, C. A.; Skinner, R.

This study aims to examine whether farmers learn from their past experiences of exposure to climate extremes and use the knowledge to better adapt to future climate extremes. Design/methodology/approach The authors used data collected from 184 farmers from Haryana over three consecutive wheat seasons from 2013-2014 to 2015-2016 and multivariate logit model to analyse the driver of the adoption of CAW as an ex ante climate risk mitigating strategies based on their learning and censored Tobit model to analyse the intensity of adoption of CAW as an ex ante climate risk mitigation strategy. Farmer's knowledge and key barriers to the adoption of CAW were determined through focus group discussions. Findings The analysis shows that the majority of farmers who had applied CAW in the year 2014-2015 (a year with untimely excess rainfall during the wheat season) have continued to practice CAW and have increased the proportion of land area allocated to it. Many farmers shifted from CTW to CAW in 2015-2016. Originality/value This paper uses three years panel data from 184 farm households in Haryana, India, together with focus groups discussions with farmers and interviews with key informants to assess if farmers learn adaptation to climate change from past climate extremes.","[Prakash Aryal, Jeetendra; Bahadur Rahut, Dil; Stirling, Clare] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, El Batan, Mexico; [Jat, M.

Based on the large body of literature on adaptation to both climatic and other stresses, this paper examines the scalar interconnections and nested hierarchical nature of adaptation decision. Drawing on case studies from around the world, we propose three stages of nested adaptation: (a) coping with change, (b) incremental adjustment to manage risk, and (c) system transformation. The effectiveness of coping is often marginal but forms benchmarks against which future adaptation to climate change can be assessed. Incremental adaptations, largely associated with technological fixes, involve more exogenous actors and operate at a greater scale than coping. Transformational adaptation is expected to occur when the rate and magnitude of change threatens to overwhelm the system. Nested with multiple-scale spatial hierarchy, the three pathways to climate adaptation are interconnected; understanding the cross-scale interactions, feedback loops and the spatial and temporal dynamics within the hierarchy is important because it affects planning and policy integration, including allocation of financial resources.","[Chhetri, Netra] Arizona State Univ, Sch Future Innovat Soc, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Stuhlmacher, Michelle; Ishtiaque, Asif] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Chhetri, N (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Future Innovat Soc, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",Netra.Chhetri@asu.edu; Michelle.Stuhlmacher@asu.edu; Asif.Ishtiaque@asu.edu,"Ishtiaque, Asif/P-2423-2019","Ishtiaque, Asif/0000-0002-2196-9764",,,,,106,23,23,4,4,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",2515-7620,,,ENVIRON RES COMMUN,Environ.

The highest C-stock, in SF, was around 320 Mg ha(-1), the lowest, 74 Mg ha(-1), was in CAF4, with the older agroforestry systems being intermediate with 120 to 150 Mg ha(-1). Soil compaction after forest conversion led to increased BD and reduced MP, K-s, and AWC. Older agroforestry partly recovered buffering: AWC per m of rooted soil profile increased by 5.7 mm per unit (g kg(-1)) increase of C-org.

In theory, adaptation policy creates the conditions needed to support autonomous adaptation - or deliver public adaptation if autonomous adaptation fails to develop. However, little attention has been given to autonomous adaptation by private households and individuals, and how it is taken into account in cities' strategic adaptation planning. Against this background, this paper examines the synergies between measures taken by city authorities and citizens, and, more specifically, how public adaptation planning enhances or inhibits private (individual) adaptation. Based on a literature review and an in-depth study of German municipalities, existing types of city-citizen interaction are systematized. The results show that targeted city-citizen collaboration for climate change adaptation is practically non-existent. City authorities rarely pay sufficient attention to financial and structural aid for individual adaptation. Conversely, the available municipal support for individual adaptation has little take-up by members of the public. Furthermore, urban policy and planning often counteract collaboration and the implementation of measures that meet citizens' capacities and needs. The paper concludes that improving city-citizen collaboration for adaptation co-production is an important step in fostering transformative adaptation, if the barriers and driving forces identified in the study are addressed. The framework that is presented advances theory on city-citizen interactions for adaptation co-production, providing a basis for related analyses, action and further research. (c) 2016 The Authors.

Adaptation researchers have either failed to demonstrate the relevance of their findings to practitioners and policymakers, or stakeholders have based their views and decisions on other kinds of information. In addition, in sectors such as agriculture, forestry, nature conservation, urban planning, water management and energy supply, adaptation has been studied separately from mitigation, which contradicts the reality of many practitioners. This paper identifies five bottlenecks to the use of adaptation research in adaptation practice and policy. These bottlenecks have gone unnoticed because the traditional framing of adaptation does not adequately consider the notion of agency, often rendering stakeholder interactions ineffective. Knowledge and use of actor-oriented theory when analysing and discussing adaptation needs and options could serve to find ways to overcome the bottlenecks and narrow the gap between research and action. The paper presents a novel framework for actor-oriented adaptation research that is being conducted within the Nordic Centre of Excellence for Strategic Adaptation Research (NORD-STAR). It frames climate adaptation as addressing both the impacts of climate change and the consequences of climate policy. Two methodological approaches - modelling and visualisation, and policy analysis - are applied to three thematic issues: land-use change, energy transitions, and insurance and finance.

The complexity of these issues is a consequence of the existence of several distinct sources of risk, including not only fluvial, tidal and coastal flooding, but also exposure to urban runoff and local drainage failure, and the various management strategies that can be proposed. The high degree of vulnerability that characterizes such areas is expected to increase in the future due to the effects of climate change, the growth of the population living in cities, and urban densification. An increasing awareness of the socio-economic losses and environmental impact of urban flooding is clearly reflected in the recent expansion of the number of studies related to the modelling and management of urban flooding, sometimes within the framework of adaptation to climate change. The goal of the current paper is to provide a general review of the recent advances in flood-risk modelling and management, while also exploring future perspectives in these fields of research.","[Cea, Luis] Univ A Coruna, Dept Civil Engn, Water & Environm Engn Grp, La Coruna 15001, Spain; [Costabile, Pierfranco] Univ Calabria, Dept Environm Engn, I-87036 Cosenza, Italy",Universidade da Coruna; University of Calabria,"Cea, L (corresponding author), Univ A Coruna, Dept Civil Engn, Water & Environm Engn Grp, La Coruna 15001, Spain.;Costabile, P (corresponding author), Univ Calabria, Dept Environm Engn, I-87036 Cosenza, Italy.",luis.cea@udc.es; pierfranco.costabile@unical.it,"Cea, Luis/F-3813-2016","Cea, Luis/0000-0002-3920-0478; Costabile, Pierfranco/0000-0003-1147-9929",,,,,364,11,11,15,37,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2306-5338,,HYDROLOGY-BASEL,Hydrology,MAR,2022,9,3,,,,,,,50,10.3390/hydrology9030050,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology9030050,,,35,Water Resources,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Water Resources,0C4AJ,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000775257600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate change is likely to increase the scale of displacement in the Asia Pacific region, leading to intensified patterns of migration as well as resettlement. These two processes, though differing in terms of individual agency and the role of the state, are likely to further exacerbate pressure on urban areas. As the limits to adaptation in risky places are reached, people are increasingly pursuing migration as a way of coping. This strategy demonstrates people's agency to respond to risks and opportunities. Resettlement, in contrast, tends to undermine people's agency. This risk response is increasingly being implemented by states as part of climate change adaptation plans, yet, it often results in the creation of new vulnerabilities for those forcibly resettled. Through a focus on the 'climate hotspot' of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, this paper explores how communities and governments might anticipate and resolve some of the humanitarian, livelihood and ecological challenges associated with resettlement in an increasingly resource-constrained and risky climate future. The concept of just resilience is proposed as a lens through which the consequences of resettlement for people's connections to place, each other and familiar ways of life can be understood. It is argued that a focus on just resilience reveals opportunities and threats to procedural, distributive and recognition elements of justice associated with adapting to climate change.","[Miller, Fiona] Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, W3A 426, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Miller, F (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, W3A 426, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",fiona.miller@mq.edu.au,,"Miller, Fiona/0000-0003-4427-6466",,,,,97,16,16,1,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0042-0980,1360-063X,,URBAN STUD,Urban Stud.,MAY,2020,57,7,,,SI,,1570,1587,,10.1177/0042098019830239,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0042098019830239,,,18,Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,LN4MU,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000532914400013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adaptation investments are required in order to limit the projected increase in natural disaster risks. Adaptation measures can reduce risk partially or completely eliminate risk. The literature on behavioural economics suggests that individuals rarely undertake measures that limit risk partially, while they may place a considerable value on measures that reduce risk to zero. This is studied for a case of adaptation to climate change and its effects on flood risk in the Netherlands. In particular, we examine whether households are willing to invest in elevating newly built structures when this is framed as eliminating flood risk. The results indicate that a majority of homeowners (52%) is willing to make a substantial investment of a,not sign10,000 to elevate a new house to a level that is safe to flooding. Differences between willingness to pay (WTP) for flood insurance and WTP for risk elimination through elevation indicate that individuals place a considerable value on the latter adaptation option. This study estimates that the safety premium which individuals place on risk elimination is approximately between a,not sign35 and a,not sign45 per month. The existence of a safety premium has important implications for the design of climate change adaptation policies. The decision to invest in elevating homes is significantly correlated with the expected negative effects of climate change, perceptions of flood risks, individual risk attitudes, and living close to a main river.","[Botzen, W.

The current mega-drought in Chile has impacts on water resources and forest vigor, particularly in the Mediterranean and Temperate regions where honey production is concentrated. While honey production plays an important role in the local rural economy and providing pollination services to other agricultural activities, studies of the long-term impacts of the mega-drought on honey production are scarce. Here, we evaluate the impact of climate variability on historical changes in honey production in the Mediterranean (32 degrees S-37 degrees S) and Temperate (37 degrees S-41 degrees S) regions of Chile, using annual honey production records of beekeepers together with national records of honey exports. We also used questionnaires and interviews to evaluate beekeeper perceptions regarding the effects of climate change on honey production and adaptation practices in both regions. Results indicated a declining trend in honey production and exports in the last decade, largely related to changes in precipitation and temperature in both regions. Declines in honey production affected 82% of beekeepers, 80% of whom had employed adaptive measures, and 74% considered that these measures were effective. The drier, warmer Mediterranean region showed more severe declines in precipitation and honey production, which beekeepers reported as a main contributing factor to transhumance from the Mediterranean to the Temperate region. This is the first study to show the effects of drought on honey production in Chile, providing a foundation for future climate change adaptation strategies within apiculture.","[Gajardo-Rojas, Martina; Munoz, Ariel A.; Klock-Barria, Karin; Olea, Matias] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Geog, Ave Brasil 2241, Valparaiso 2362807, Chile; [Gajardo-Rojas, Martina; Munoz, Ariel A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Acc Climat, Valparaiso, Chile; [Munoz, Ariel A.] Ctr Ciencia Clima & Resiliencia CR 2, Santiago, Chile; [Barichivich, Jonathan] Lab Sci Climat & Environm LSCE, Paris, France; [Gayo, Eugenia M.] Inst Ecol & Biodiversidad IEB, Santiago, Chile; [Fonturbel, Francisco E.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Lucas, Christine M.] Univ Republ, Polo Ecol Fluvial, Dept Agua, CENUR Litoral Norte, Paysandu, Uruguay; [Veas, Camilo] Ctr Interdisciplinario Estudios Terr Litorales &, Valparaiso, Chile","Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Gajardo-Rojas, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Geog, Ave Brasil 2241, Valparaiso 2362807, Chile.",martina.gajardo.r@gmail.com,"Fontúrbel, Francisco E./C-7756-2009; Lucas, Christine/K-8795-2018","Fontúrbel, Francisco E./0000-0001-8585-2816; Olea, Matias/0000-0003-0194-7784; Gayo, Eugenia M./0000-0003-0746-0512; Lucas, Christine/0000-0003-2460-1516","ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program [NCN19_153, ANID PIA/BASAL FB210006];  [ANID-FONDEF ID21I10422];  [ANID-FSEQ110023];  [ESR UCV2095];  [PUCV No039.431/2020];  [ANID/FONDAP/15110009]",ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program; ; ; ; ; ,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: MGR, AAM were supported by grants: ANID-FONDEF ID21I10422, ANID-FSEQ110023, ESR UCV2095, PUCV No039.431/2020.

Quantifying the synergic influence of climate and human-driven environmental changes on human health is, therefore, critical for identifying climate change adaptation pathways for this vulnerable region. Here we show a significant increase (1.2%-267%) in hospitalisations for respiratory diseases in children under-five in municipalities highly exposed to drought. Aerosol was the primary driver of hospitalisations in drought affected municipalities during 2005, while human development conditions mitigated the impacts in 2010. Our results demonstrated that drought events deteriorated children's respiratory health particularly during 2005 when the drought was more geographically concentrated. This indicates that if governments act on curbing fire usage and effectively plan public health provision, as a climate change adaptation procedure, health quality would improve and public expenditure for treatment would decrease in the region during future drought events.","[Smith, Lauren T.; Aragao, Luiz E.

Drawing on principles of the ecosystem resilience highlighted in the literature, we built on the theory of dissipative structures to develop a conceptual model of the ecosystem resilience of forests. A hierarchical indicator system was designed with the influencing factors of the forest ecosystem resilience, including the stand conditions and the ecological memory, which were further disaggregated into specific indicators. Furthermore, indicator weights were determined with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the coefficient of variation method. Based on the remote sensing data and forest inventory data and so forth, the resilience index of forests was calculated. The result suggests that there is significant spatial heterogeneity of the ecosystem resilience of forests, indicating it is feasible to generate large-scale ecosystem resilience maps with this assessment model, and the results can provide a scientific basis for the conservation of forests, which is of great significance to the climate change mitigation.","[Yan, Haiming; Zhan, Jinyan] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Liu, Bing] Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geomat, Qingdao 266590, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Huang, Wei] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Li, Zhihui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhihui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhihui] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Beijing Normal University; Shandong University of Science & Technology; University of Gottingen; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Zhan, JY (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",zhanjy@bnu.edu.cn,"zhan, jinyan/GYU-4910-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41071343, 71225005, 40801231]; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2010CB950900]; Key Project in the National Science & Technology Pillar Program of China [2013BAC03B00]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(National Basic Research Program of China); Key Project in the National Science & Technology Pillar Program of China,"This research was supported by the Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 41071343), the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) (Grant no. 2010CB950900), and the Key Project in the National Science & Technology Pillar Program of China (no. 2013BAC03B00).

This is important as recent evolutionary approaches to resilience have highlighted how resilience is an on-going process of adaptation which emphasises the temporal, fluid and open-ended aspects of individuals' experiences and practices in shaping everyday lives. In turn, this means that individuals' experiences and practices can lead to different strategies of staying (as well as moving) in the face of climate change. Consequently, the paper highlights four key areas where more research is required in order to explore the links between climate change, `staying' and resilience. These include the importance of historical context in disentangling and contextualising the multicausal nature of individuals' mobility decisions; translocal networks in shaping mobility or immobility; the influence of equity, diversity and gendered social expectations on staying; and the importance of governance responses in facilitating resilience, adaptation and subsequent decisions by individuals to stay or move.","[Pemberton, Simon] Keele Univ, Sch Geog Geol & Environm, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England; [Furlong, Basundhara Tripathy] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Sch Social Sci, Sociol Dev Change & Environm Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Scanlan, Oliver] Univ Liberal Arts Bangladesh, Ctr Sustainable Dev, House 56,Rd 4-A Satmasjid Rd Dhanmondi, Dhaka 1209, Bangladesh; [Koubi, Vally] Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich ETH, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies, IFW C 43-2,Haldeneggsteig 4, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Guhathakurta, Meghna] Res Initiat Bangladesh, House 07,Rd 17,Block C, Dhaka 1213, Bangladesh; [Hossain, Md Khalid] IUCN Bangladesh, House B-138 Levels 5&6,Rd 22, Dhaka 1206, Bangladesh; [Warner, Jeroen; Roth, Dik] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Sch Social Sci, Sociol Dev Change Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Keele University; Wageningen University & Research; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Wageningen University & Research,"Furlong, BT (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Sch Social Sci, Sociol Dev Change & Environm Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",s.pemberton@keele.ac.uk; basundhara.tripathy@wur.nl; oliver.scanlan@ulab.edu.bd; koubi@ir.gess.ethz.ch; khalid.hossain@iucn.org; jeroen.warner@wur.nl; dik.roth@wur.nl,,,Center for Sustainable Development (CSD) at University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh,Center for Sustainable Development (CSD) at University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh,The Center for Sustainable Development (CSD) at University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh provided logistical and financial support in organizing the 4th CSD Annual Conference on Sustainable Development 2019.

This approach emphasises the need to analyse vulnerability across sectors and to develop adaptation interventions that create positive cross-sectoral impacts. This paper suggests that community forestry, as an already-embedded form of commoning, could be a useful entry point for implementing integrated adaptation. It presents a community forestry-based climate change adaptation (CF-CCA) framework, as conceived and implemented in Nepal's Terai. It then evaluates the framework - through the lens of political ecology - and its approach to community level data collection, building linkages with local government, and the tenability of scaling up the framework in its current form. We conclude by asserting that the CF-CCA framework is a promising tool for integrated adaptation that must be further politicised in order to address dynamic issues of power and inequality and provide emancipatory change.","[Chowdhary, C.

Most studies focus on the effect of heat and water availability on crop yields, but little is known about the impact of changes in intra-seasonal climate variability (particularly challenging in mountain regions). Also, beyond the effect on crop yields-mostly focused on single cropping systems and major world crops-little analysis has been done on more complex, diversified and low-input cropping systems like those prevalent in the Andean region. This study investigates whether Andean farmers respond to increasing climate variability by increasing crop diversity (measured by intercropping and crop diversification indices) and by switching to crops which better tolerate heterogeneous environmental conditions. Since previous studies show that crop diversification fosters resilience of agricultural systems, decreasing crop portfolio diversity in an increasingly variable environment may challenge farms sustainability. The data used in the analysis combines district-level socio-economic information from two agrarian censuses (1994 and 2012) with district-level climate estimates of mean temperature, temperature range and precipitation (averages for periods 1964-1994 and 1982-2012). Based on fixed effects models that allow for sub-region parameter heterogeneity, I find that an increase in intra-seasonal climate variability leads farmers in colder areas (<11 degrees C during the growing season) to concentrate their portfolio into more tolerant crops and reduce intercropping (a practice potentially efficient at controlling pest and disease). This effect is especially strong in the Southern region (more indigenous, less integrated to markets). These results complement previous studies by providing robust and regionally representative evidence on small-farmers' nonlinear response to climate variability. Furthermore, given that Andean farmers received little-to-no help to adapt to climate change during the period under analysis, this study informs about farmers' autonomous adaptation to climate changes and raises concern on current adaptation responses that may hamper agricultural system's sustainability in the face of climate change.

We review the existing literature on the likely economic impacts of climate change, acting through water supply and demand effects in specific river basins, and the ability of adaptation to mitigate those impacts. Since adaptive responses will be implemented largely by local, regional, and national water management institutions, we also review what is known about the responses of water users to water prices, non-price water conservation policies, water trading, investment in and operations of storage and conveyance infrastructure, and transboundary water allocation mechanisms the set of policy levers typically available to water managers at various geographic scales. Remaining gaps in the empirical economic literature on these topics are identified. The paper also describes the potential contributions of linking existing and new empirical research on water resource adaptation with IAMs. The importance of further empirical economic and political-economic research on the role of water management institutions in adaptation, or maladaptation, to climate change emerges as an important theme.

Recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and governmental reports show that this will be endangered by climate change. Recent high-resolution hydro-climatic model outputs give cause for further concern. Additionally, the South African Government is under pressure to implement progressive new water regulations; shift its overall water management approach; deal with skills shortages at all institutional levels; and cope with immense disparities and, hence, vulnerabilities within society. South Africa therefore faces huge water challenges in the coming years. This article questions whether the country's regulatory frameworks and laws on water sufficiently support adaptation to climate change. Furthermore, questions are raised on incorporating climatic and other uncertainties into decision-making processes. It is concluded that South African water law and regulatory systems do offer sufficient flexibility and openness to cope with an adaptive and participatory management approach.

First, in contrast to mitigation, innovation in CCATs only slowly takes off, indicating a relatively low awareness of investors for solutions to cope with climate risks. We discuss how historical trends in environmental regulation, energy prices, and public support may have contributed to patenting in CCATs. Second, CCATs form two main clusters: science-intensive ones in agriculture, health, and monitoring technologies; and engineering-intensive ones in coastal, water, and infrastructure technologies. Analyses of technology-specific scientific and technological knowledge bases inform directions for how to facilitate advancement, transfer and use of CCATs. Lastly, CCATs show strong technological complementarities with mitigation as more than 25% of CCATs bear mitigation benefits. While not judging about the complementarity of mitigation and adaptation in general, our results suggest how policymakers can harness these technological synergies to achieve both goals simultaneously.","[Hotte, Kerstin] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Programme Technol & Econ Change, Oxford, England; [Hotte, Kerstin; Jee, Su Jung] Univ Oxford, Inst New Econ Thinking Oxford Martin Sch, Oxford, England; [Hotte, Kerstin] Univ Bielefeld, Fac Business Adm & Econ, Bielefeld, Germany; [Jee, Su Jung] Univ Bradford, Fac Management Law & Social Sci, Sch Management, Bradford, England; [Hotte, Kerstin] Oxford Martin Sch, 34 Broad St, Oxford OX1 3BD, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Bielefeld; University of Bradford; University of Oxford,"Hotte, K (corresponding author), Oxford Martin Sch, 34 Broad St, Oxford OX1 3BD, England.",kerstin.hotte@oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk,,"Hotte, Kerstin/0000-0002-8633-4225",OMPTEC; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [2020R1A6A3A03037237],"OMPTEC; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Education (MOE), Republic of KoreaNational Research Council for Economics, Humanities & Social Sciences, Republic of Korea)","The authors want to thank Sugandha Srivastav who significantly contributed to an earlier version of this article, in both intellectual and practical ways.

Adaptation does not necessarily imply favorable or equitable change, nor does it automatically imply sustainable use of ecosystems. Sustainable adaptation in this case implies strategic, collective action to respond to or anticipate harmful climate change to reduce disruption to key resource flows and adverse effects on general well-being. This research examined social-ecological system responses to recent warming trends in the remote northwest region of Interior Alaska using a unique vulnerability and adaptive capacity assessment (VA) approach that integrated indigenous observations and understanding of climate (IC) with western social and natural sciences. The study found that Alaska Native communities that were historically highly mobile and flexible across the landscape for subsistence hunting are increasingly restricted by the institutional rigidity of the regulatory system for wildlife and subsistence management. This has resulted in negative impacts to game harvest access and success threatening food security and community well-being. This suggests that policies limiting the ability of natural resource-dependent societies to be flexible, diversify, or innovate can threaten livelihoods and exacerbate vulnerability. Nevertheless, opportunities for sustainable adaptation exist where wildlife management is adaptive and includes an understanding of and response to climate variability and slow-onset climate change with the human dimensions of subsistence hunting for more effective in-season management.","[McNeeley, Shannon M.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Adv Study Program, Integrated Sci Program, Res Applicat Lab, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [McNeeley, Shannon M.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Anthropol, Fairbanks, AK USA; [McNeeley, Shannon M.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, IGERT Resilience & Adaptat Program, Fairbanks, AK USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks,"McNeeley, SM (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Adv Study Program, Integrated Sci Program, Res Applicat Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",smcneele@ucar.edu,,,National Science Foundation through the National Center for Atmospheric Research; University of Alaska Fairbanks,National Science Foundation through the National Center for Atmospheric Research(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); University of Alaska Fairbanks,"This research was funded by the National Science Foundation through the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

Design/methodology/approach - The study draws upon a range of data collection techniques including a comprehensive literature reviewrelating to DRR and CCA in general and in the SADCmember states, face-to-face interviews and an online survey. A mixed method research design was applied to the study with a total of 35 respondents from Botswana, Madagascar, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe participating in the face-to-face interviews and an online survey. Findings - The analysis shows that DRR and CCA are carried out by different departments, agencies and/or ministries in all but three SADC member states, namely, Mozambique, Mauritius and the Seychelles. Participants were able to highlight the different ways in which integration should unfold. In light of this, the paper proposes a normative model to integrate government organisations for DRR and CCA within SADC member states. Originality/value - The implementation of the model has the potential to accelerate the integration of organisations for DRR and CCA, with the resultant improvement in the implementation of risk reduction strategies and efficient use of resources.","[Nemakonde, Livhuwani David] North West Univ, African Ctr Disaster Studies, Sch Geo & Spatial Sci, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Van Niekerk, Dewald] North West Univ, African Ctr Disaster Studies, Disaster Risk Reduct, Potchefstroom Campus, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Van Niekerk, Dewald] North West Univ, African Ctr Disaster Studies, Potchefstroom Campus, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa; North West University - South Africa; North West University - South Africa,"Nemakonde, LD (corresponding author), North West Univ, African Ctr Disaster Studies, Sch Geo & Spatial Sci, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",livhuwani.nemakonde@acds.co.za,"Nemakonde, Livhuwani/AAE-6439-2020; van Niekerk, Dewald/H-6134-2012; Nemakonde, Livhuwani/AAK-2946-2021","Nemakonde, Livhuwani/0000-0002-3458-5575; van Niekerk, Dewald/0000-0002-4571-4205; ",,,,,50,12,15,1,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0965-3562,1758-6100,,DISASTER PREV MANAG,Disaster Prev.

Regional Studies. This paper examines how adaptation is interpreted across different UK city-regions by governance and policy actors, finding that the discourse of adaptation is giving way to resilience. This is explained by the value of resilience as a discursive construct in mobilizing and coordinating policy actions. Resilience has greater appeal as a framing device over adaptation to such actors given its potential to enable buy-in from a wider city-regional governance network. However, this paper also highlights the 'resilience trap': the dangers of adopting short-term strategies, re-badging existing strategies and widening governance networks that obfuscate sub-national mobilization around adaptation. It then reflects on how governance actors may act to avoid the resilience trap.","[Kythreotis, Andrew P.] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Geog & Planning, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Kythreotis, Andrew P.; Bristow, Gillian I.] Cardiff Univ, Sustainable Places Res Inst, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Kythreotis, Andrew P.] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Zuckerman Inst Connect Environm Res, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich, Norfolk, England",Cardiff University; Cardiff University; University of East Anglia,"Kythreotis, AP (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Geog & Planning, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.;Kythreotis, AP (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sustainable Places Res Inst, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.;Kythreotis, AP (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Zuckerman Inst Connect Environm Res, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich, Norfolk, England.",kythreotisa@cardiff.ac.uk; bristowg1@cardiff.ac.uk,,"Kythreotis, Andrew/0000-0002-9436-8185",Regional Studies Association,Regional Studies Association,Special thanks go to the Regional Studies Association for funding this research under an RSA Early Career Grant held by the first author.,,82,27,27,2,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Bulk infrastructure tends to determine urban communities' vulnerability to water supply and this infrastructure tends to be managed by the government. This suggests that water supply adaptation will require government capacity and commitment - often lacking in the developing country context. This article focuses on the processes impeding and facilitating adaptation to climate change within the urban water sector in the City of Cape Town, South Africa. The case study explores water management at the city scale, highlighting how actors currently respond to water stress and the challenges they face in integrating climate change information into water management. The case study results suggest that the best ways to facilitate adaptation are to focus on areas where development needs and responses to climate change impacts are connected, and focus support on adaptation processes rather than outcomes. This approach is likely to ensure that climate change responses are not seen as competing with non-climate development priorities, but as part of the solution to them. This is likely to create incentives for the global South to respond to climate change.","[Ziervogel, Gina] Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [Ziervogel, Gina; Shale, Moliehi] Oxford Off, Stockholm Environm Inst, Oxford OX2 7JT, England; [Shale, Moliehi] Univ Cape Town, Ctr Criminol, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [Du, Minlei] Environm Resources Management ERM China, Beijing 100027, Peoples R China",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Ziervogel, G (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa.",gina@csag.uct.ac.za,"Ziervogel, Gina/AAG-2945-2019","Ziervogel, Gina/0000-0003-4219-6809",,,,,61,57,57,2,80,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

This study compares two groups of Swedish forest owners: 1493 who participated in two climate communication projects by the Swedish Forest Agency, and 909 who were randomly sampled. The study finds statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of climate change awareness and concern, belief in the urgency to act and intentions to take adaptive measures. Results suggest that the primary effect of the climate chance communication seems to have been on forest owners' subjective risk perceptions and beliefs in their knowledge and ability, which make it more likely that individuals will take adaptive action in the future. The study also finds that experience with extreme events affects people's intentions to take adaptive measures independently from their beliefs that these extremes were caused by climate change. Furthermore, findings also highlight the need for communication research and practice to recognise the impeding role social norms and economic rationales can play for individual adaptation. Future research should make use of longitudinal and qualitative research to assess the effect of deliberation- and solution-orientated communication on people's intentions and actions to adapt to climate change.","[Vulturius, Gregor; Andre, Karin; Swartling, Asa Gerger] Stockholm Environm Inst, Linnegatan 87D, S-11523 Stockholm, Sweden; [Vulturius, Gregor; Rounsevell, Mark] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Brown, Calum; Rounsevell, Mark] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany",Stockholm Environment Institute; University of Edinburgh; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Vulturius, G (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Linnegatan 87D, S-11523 Stockholm, Sweden.;Vulturius, G (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",gregor.vulturius@sei.org,"Rounsevell, Mark D A/AAC-4498-2021; Brown, Calum/ABH-4673-2020; Swartling, Åsa C Gerger/J-1420-2018","Rounsevell, Mark D A/0000-0001-7476-9398; Brown, Calum/0000-0001-9331-1008; Swartling, Åsa C Gerger/0000-0003-3616-7323; Andre, Karin/0000-0002-0373-0143; Vulturius, Gregor/0000-0001-8899-2267",Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (Mistra); Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida),Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (Mistra)(Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research); Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida),This research was funded by the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (Mistra) and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida).

The ISAMS incorporates global climate models (GCMs), a semi-distributed land use-based runoff process (SLURP) model, and a multistage interval-stochastic programming (MISP) approach within a general framework. The ISAMS can not only handle uncertainties expressed as probability distributions and interval values but also reveal climate change impacts on water resources allocation under different projections of GCMs. The ISAMS is then applied to the Kaidu-kongque watershed with cold arid characteristics in the Tarim River Basin (the largest inland watershed basin in China) for demonstrating its efficiency. Results reveal that different climate change models corresponding to various projections (e.g., precipitation and temperature) would lead to changed water resources allocation patterns. Variations in water availability and demand due to uncertainties could result in different water allocation targets and shortages. A variety of decision alternatives about water allocations adaptive to climate change are generated under combinations of different global climate models and ecological water release plans. These findings indicate that understanding the uncertainties in water resources system, building adaptive methods for generating sustainable water allocation patterns, and taking actions for mitigating water shortage problems are key adaptation strategies responding to climate change.","[Sun, J.; Zhuang, X.

The objective of this report is to inform the nutrition and public health communities about the potential contributions of ancient Andean technologies to address these contemporary challenges. Our research examines these ancient farming technologies within the frame of climate change and dietary potential. Specifically, we focus on 4 technologies derived from 3 case studies from Ecuador. These technologies were analyzed using evidence mainly of adaptation to climate change in indigenous-based agriculture. Our examination of these technologies suggests they could be effective mechanisms for adapting to climate change and protecting food sovereignty. Thus, although highly vulnerable to climate change, indigenous peoples in the Andes should also be seen as agents of change.","[Carrasco-Torrontegui, Amaya] Univ Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Carrasco-Torrontegui, Amaya] Fac Latinoamer Ciencias Sociales, Quito, Ecuador; [Gallegos-Riofrio, Carlos Andres] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Gallegos-Riofrio, Carlos Andres; Delgado-Espinoza, Florencio] Univ San Francisco Quito, Quito, Ecuador; [Swanson, Mark] Univ Kentucky, Lexington, KY USA",University of Vermont; Washington University (WUSTL); University of Kentucky,"Carrasco-Torrontegui, A (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.;Carrasco-Torrontegui, A (corresponding author), Fac Latinoamer Ciencias Sociales, Quito, Ecuador.",amayacarrascot@gmail.com,,"Delgado Espinoza, Florencio/0000-0002-3340-7128",Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community's Seeds of Native Health campaign; Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community,Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community's Seeds of Native Health campaign; Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community,"This article appears as part of the supplement Proceedings of the Fourth Annual Conference on Native American Nutrition, sponsored by the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community's Seeds of Native Health campaign through a gift to the University of Minnesota.

Nature-based solutions (NbS) are increasingly implemented to help local communities adapt to climatic hazards. However, the relevance of their location in relation to those hazards and local NCP has hardly been addressed. In the PORTAL (Pathways of Transformation in the Alps) project, we identified and mapped a portfolio of 97 NbS for climate change adaptation in the European Alps. Most NbS addressed drought or soil instability and aimed to provide multiple NCP simultaneously such as wood production and protective function against landslides. We analysed whether NbS are located where they are the most needed, according to both current and future intensity of the hazards they aim to address and to supply-flow-demand indicators of the NCP they aim to provide. We found that the location of NbS is not overall related to current supply-flow-demand indicators of most NCP, nor to the intensity of hazards. Nevertheless, NbS addressing droughts and floods are located in areas where these hazards are more intense, but do not match higher values for NCP indicators. Conversely, NbS aiming to produce wood and to provide protective function against landslides are located in areas with greater levels of these NCP, regardless of the intensity of hazards. These results suggest that hazards and NCP indicators are not the main drivers of NbS implementation. We argue that integrating local climate conditions and current NCP flows is needed to underpin a macro-regional strategy for planning NbS implementation.","[Dubo, Titouan; Cugniet, Audrey; Racinais, Natacha; Lavorel, Sandra] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Univ Savoie Mont Blanc, CNRS, LECA, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Palomo, Ignacio] Univ Grenoble Alpes, IRD, CNRS, Grenoble INP,IGE, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Camacho, Lucia Laorden] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Ecol, Innsbruck, Austria; [Locatelli, Bruno] Univ Montpellier, Cirad, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Locatelli, Bruno] Cifor, Lima 15024, Peru",UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); University of Innsbruck; CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),"Dubo, T (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, Univ Savoie Mont Blanc, CNRS, LECA, F-38000 Grenoble, France.",titouan.dubo@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr; ignacio.palomo@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr; lucialaordencamacho@gmail.com; bruno.locatelli@cirad.fr; audreycugniet28@hotmail.fr; natacha.racinais@gmail.com; sandra.lavorel@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr,,"Dubo, Titouan/0000-0002-8546-0561",French National Research Agency's Programme d'Investissements d'Avenir-Make Our Planet Great Again;  [ANR-19-MPGA-0009],French National Research Agency's Programme d'Investissements d'Avenir-Make Our Planet Great Again(French National Research Agency (ANR)); ,Funding was provided by the French National Research Agency's Programme d'Investissements d'Avenir-Make Our Planet Great Again (grant no.

The results from this assessment will enhance the formation of robust policies that improve resilient livelihoods and the capacity to adapt to climate change and variability. This paper seeks to (i) reveal the farmers' perception on variation, change of rainfall, and temperature in the Tanzanian semi-arid area; (ii) depict meteorological evidence for the perceived rainfall and temperature changes; (iii) assess the policy perception and responses for the changing climate; and (iv) discuss the correlation between farmers' perception and meteorological data. Household surveys, informative interviews and discussions were employed during data collection. The Mann-Kendall Test and SPSS (version 20) were used for climate data analyses, while qualitative data were thematically analyzed. The results showed that from 1980 to 2015 the mean annual rainfall decreased (R-2 = 0.21) while temperature increased (R-2 = 0.30). Even though majority farmers agreed with these results, they had not yet taken serious measures to curb the situation. Besides, Agricultural Policy has lightly addressed and enforced the implementations of adaptation strategies to reduce climate impacts and vulnerability. Thereby, creation of awareness and intensification of climate adaptation strategies is needed at both farm and policy level.","[Mkonda, Msafiri Y.; He, Xinhua] Southwest Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Ctr Excellence Soil Biol, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Mkonda, Msafiri Y.] Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Phys Sci, Fac Sci, Morogoro 3038, Tanzania; [He, Xinhua] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley 6009, Australia",Southwest University - China; Sokoine University of Agriculture; University of Western Australia,"Mkonda, MY; He, XH (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Ctr Excellence Soil Biol, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.;Mkonda, MY (corresponding author), Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Phys Sci, Fac Sci, Morogoro 3038, Tanzania.;He, XH (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley 6009, Australia.",msamkonda81@yahoo.co.uk; xinhua.he@uwa.edu.au,"Mkonda, Msafiri/H-9317-2019; He, Xinhua/AAK-1548-2020; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; He, Xinhua/D-6920-2011","Mkonda, Msafiri/0000-0002-1626-3724; He, Xinhua/0000-0002-5570-3454",Chinese Government Scholarship (CSC); China Scholar Council International PhD Program; Chongqing 100 Talents Program,Chinese Government Scholarship (CSC); China Scholar Council International PhD Program; Chongqing 100 Talents Program,"We are indebted to the Chinese Government Scholarship (CSC) for providing the scholarship for Msafiri Y.

Through the investigation of eleven case studies, our research demonstrates the presence of these co-benefits where integration is observed. Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) is used to link observed input variables to identified co-benefits. This research suggests that integration is an effective means of generating co-benefits that contribute positively to project outcomes. The research further concludes that effective leadership support, either through public-private partnership and energy policy, is one means of achieving such explicit integration. Energy policy, in the form of voluntary instruments and incentives, is recommended to build necessary public-private partnerships and support leadership. Such policy recommendations have applications far beyond the energy sector and the lessons learned here can likely be applied to cases outside of it.","[Hennessey, Ryan] Govt Yukon, 206A Lowe St, Whitehorse, YT 2C6, Canada; [Pittman, Jeremy] Univ Waterloo, Sch Environm Resources & Sustainabil, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Morand, Annette; Douglas, Allan] Laurentian Univ, MIRARCO, Ontario Ctr Climate Impacts & Adaptat Resources, 935 Ramsey Lake Rd, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada",University of Waterloo; Laurentian University,"Hennessey, R (corresponding author), Govt Yukon, 206A Lowe St, Whitehorse, YT 2C6, Canada.",ryan.hennessey@gov.yk.ca,,,"Energy Working Group of the Climate Impacts and Adaptation Division, Natural Resources Canada, Government of Canada","Energy Working Group of the Climate Impacts and Adaptation Division, Natural Resources Canada, Government of Canada","This work was supported by the Energy Working Group of the Climate Impacts and Adaptation Division, Natural Resources Canada, Government of Canada.

The study aims to understand and explain the dynamic correlates between climate change and farmers' emotional regulation practices, given psychological distance. Using 180 smallholder farmers in Northern Ghana, structural equation linear regression analysis showed that given psychological distance (geographical, social), different climate change indicators significantly influenced different emotional regulation practices among farmers. Although, studies show an association between climate change and climate change adaptation practices, the study revealed that, given psychological distance, emotional regulations of farmers predicted their preferences for different climate change adaptation techniques. It is concluded that the influence of climate change on farmers' emotional regulation practices seems to predispose them to future mental (emotional) health problems. Emotional regulation also appears to be a significant factor that climate change and mental health interventionists need to pay attention to.","[Anuga, Samuel Weniga] Univ Ghana, Climate Change & Sustainable Dev Programme, Accra, Ghana; [Acharibasam, Jeremiah Wezanamo] Univ Tromso, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Clin Med, Norwegian Ctr Integrated Care & Telemed, Tromso, Norway",University of Ghana; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Anuga, SW (corresponding author), Univ Ghana, Climate Change & Sustainable Dev Programme, Accra, Ghana.",samuelanuga@rocketmail.com,,"Acharibasam, Jeremiah/0000-0003-4883-2079",,,,,52,15,15,1,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

A rural livelihoods approach was used in focus group discussions and in-depth interviews to identify and enumerate enabling and constraining adaptation factors. Smallholders experienced diverse natural hazards such as floods, abnormal rains, high temperatures, water scarcity, and salinity intrusion specific to the agro-ecological areas. Adaptation was constrained by labour shortages, water quality, topography, access to combine harvesters, transportation infrastructure, dryers and household savings. Adaptation was enabled by farming techniques and experience, cooperative groups, water quantity, access to information, and ability to purchase agro-chemicals through credit. Small farmers (< 1ha) were more constrained than large farmers (> 1ha) who had an expanded livelihood asset base.

Many of the impacts of climate change and variability have or will be experienced at the local level. Local governments are embedded in a larger governance context that has the potential to limit the effectiveness of planned adaptation initiatives on the ground. This study argues that research on constraints and barriers to adaptation must place greater attention to understanding the broader multi-governance system and cross-scale constraints that shape adaptation at the local government scale. The study identified seven key enabling actions for overcoming cross-scale challenges faced by local governments in Australia when undertaking climate change adaptation planning and implementation. A central conclusion of this study is that a cooperative and collaborative approach is needed where joint recognition of the scale of the issue and its inherent cross-scale complexities are realised. Many of the barriers or constraints to adaptation planning are interlinked, requiring a whole government approach to adaptation planning. The research suggests a stronger role at the state and national level is required for adaptation to be facilitated and supported at the local level.","[Mukheibir, Pierre; Kuruppu, Natasha; Gero, Anna; Herriman, Jade] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Mukheibir, P (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",pierre.mukheibir@uts.edu.au,,"Gero, Anna/0000-0001-7047-4250; , natasha/0000-0001-9018-826X",Australian Government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) through the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility,Australian Government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) through the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility(Australian Government),This work was carried out with financial support from the Australian Government (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) through the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility.

These changes are reported to have pronounced impacts on the livelihoods of the people in the country. Water is central to the sustainable functioning of ecosystems and wellbeing of mankind. It is evident that pronounced variations in the climate will negatively impact the availability and the quality of water resources. The ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) approach has proved to be an effective strategy to address the impact of climate change on water resources in many parts of the world. The key aim of this paper is to elaborate the wide range of benefits received through implementation of EbAs in field level, watershed scale, and urban and coastal environments in the context of Sri Lanka. In addition, this paper discusses the benefits of utilizing EbA solutions over grey infrastructure-based solutions to address the issues related to water management. The wide range of benefits received through implementation of EbAs can be broadly classified into three categories: water supply regulation, water quality regulation, and moderation of extreme events. This paper recommends the utilization of EbAs over grey infrastructure-based solutions in adaptation to climate change in the water management sector for the developing region due its cost effectiveness, ecofriendliness, and multiple benefits received on long-term scales. The findings of this study will unequivocally contribute to filling existing knowledge and research gaps in the context of EbAs to future climate change in Sri Lanka. The suggestions and opinions of this study can be taken into account by decision makers and water resources planning agencies for future planning of actions related to climate change adaptation in Sri Lanka.","[Khaniya, Bhabishya; Gunathilake, Miyuru B.; Rathnayake, Upaka] Sri Lanka Inst Informat Technol, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Malabe, Sri Lanka",Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT),"Rathnayake, PK (corresponding author), Sri Lanka Inst Informat Technol, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Malabe, Sri Lanka.",upakasanjeewa@gmail.com,"Sanjeewa, Upaka/S-2435-2019; Khaniya, Bhabishya/GXH-3769-2022; Gunathilake, Miyuru/HOA-7598-2023","Sanjeewa, Upaka/0000-0002-7341-9078; Gunathilake, Miyuru/0000-0001-7052-1942",,,,,87,3,3,3,8,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1024-123X,1563-5147,,MATH PROBL ENG,Math.

From a general reactive approach, focusing on strengthening disaster response mechanisms, we have moved to proactive approaches. There has been recognition that each element of society, from public institutions to private sector, from community-based organizations to every single individual, can make a difference by acting before disasters strike to reduce the associated risks of human and economic losses. This proactive approach can be summarized in three words: Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). Today, DRR is an approach used in several sectors and research areas. In the Development sphere, DRR is considered a key feature for sustainability of economic and development gains - especially for developing countries. Significantly, the United Nations Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction (2009) is titled Risk and poverty in a changing climate highlighting the importance of DRR in reducing poverty while being a means to address the challenges posed by adaptation to climate change. This paper, which serves as an introduction to the special issue of Environment Science & Policy on climate change impact on water-related disasters, intends to provide readers with an overview of the main policy frameworks addressing DRR internationally and in Europe. Further, it aims to offer some food for thought on the underlying opportunities we have to enhance the resilience of our communities towards the risks posed by weather-related hazards. It stresses the importance of governance of risks, which starts from an effective dialogue between the scientific community and the policy makers: those who have the responsibility to decide on the most cost-effective interventions to address climate change adaptation and risk reduction.

Literature in adaptation policy point to the lack of methods that monitor and assess how decision-making takes place and by whom. Based on a review of over 200 policy documents, this article benchmarks for the first time, the current airport climate adaptation regime in the United States and applies a sociotechnical system framework to scrutinize institutional capacity to address climate change impacts. An innovative policy review system is designed to decode how airport policies create conditions to use climate data as decision-relevant information and produce adaptation actions. Potential climate-cognizant policies are identified and characterized based on their target, timescale, and governance mode. Review results show that the assumption of climate stationarity is widespread. However, there is high potential for technical and, especially, organizational airport policies to incorporate climate science and adaptation pathways. Results also uncover governance barriers related to institutional path-dependence that include: (1) conflicting rationales between adaptation and reliability values, and (2) overpowering technical policies and market governance. These barriers perpetuate scale-mismatch between airport policies and expected impacts from climate change. Finally, we highlight the latent capacity for collaborative governance to advance adaptation regimes in airports and other multiscalar complex infrastructure systems. Our proposed methods and review results identify pathways to enhance institutional capacity for designing and operationalizing transformative adaptation policies.","[Lindbergh, S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, 230 Bauer Wurster Hall 2000, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Reed, J.; Takara, M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 107B McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rakas, J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, FAA Consortium Aviat Operat Res NEXTOR III, 107B McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Lindbergh, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, 230 Bauer Wurster Hall 2000, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",sarah_lindbergh@berkeley.edu; jrakas@berkeley.edu,,"Lindbergh, Sarah/0000-0002-0138-3088",University of California Institute of Transportation Studies from the State of California; State of California,University of California Institute of Transportation Studies from the State of California; State of California,"This study was funded by the University of California Institute of Transportation Studies from the State of California through the Public Transportation Account and the Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017 (Senate Bill 1) from the fiscal year 2020-2021.

Design/methodology/approach - While existing studies on costing adaptation base themselves on either the financial flows on conservation or the costs of specific adaptation measures at the global level, the methodology presented here takes into account the impacts on ecosystems, the identification of vulnerable areas, and adaptation options at a more regional level. Findings - The framework is then applied to forest ecosystems in India. The authors find that the total adaptation costs for forest ecosystems in India until 2085 are in the range of $1.34-2.32 billion. Originality/value - The key contribution of this paper is the proposal that for any robust estimation of adaptation costs, people should take into account the regional level impacts and the multiple adaptation options linked to those impacts.","[Ojea, Elena] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Bilbao, Basque Country, Spain; [Ghosh, Ranjan K.] Humboldt Univ, Div Resource Econ, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Agrawal, Bharat B.] TERI Univ, Energy & Resources Inst, New Delhi, India; [Joshi, P.

This increased responsibilisation of citizens has implications for the roles of governments. The degree of government involvement does not necessarily decline, but government roles may need to shift: from a regulating and steering government towards a more collaborative and responsive government that enables and facilitates community initiatives that are self-governed by citizens. However, we lack a conceptual understanding of such new government roles, as well as empirical insights into how local governments participate in citizens' initiatives and how they take up such new roles. In this paper, a ladder of government participation is introduced, which is used to explore the roles of local governments in citizens' initiatives for climate change adaptation in the Netherlands. The results show that local governments are slowly but gradually shifting towards more networking, stimulating, and facilitating roles. Key concerns of local practitioners are (a) a lack of flexibility and support of their own municipal organisation to facilitate citizens' initiatives, (b) uncertainty about the continuity of citizens' initiatives over time, and (c) a potential increase of inequity among citizen groups resulting from facilitating citizens' initiatives. An important finding is that the roles of local governments tend to be flexible, in that they can move from one role to the other over time for one and the same citizens' initiative depending on its stage of development, as well as take up several roles simultaneously for different citizens' initiatives.","[Mees, Heleen L.

Yet there is sparse evidence into the specific ways in which identity processes shape adaptation planning and responses. This paper proposes three key ways to understand the relationship between identity formation and adaptation processes: (a) how social identities change in response to perceived climate change risks and threats; (b) how identity change may be an objective of adaptation; and (c) how identity issues can constrain or enable adaptive action. It examines these three areas of focus through a synthesis of evidence on community responses to flooding and subsequent policy responses in Somerset county, UK and the Gippsland East region in Australia, based on indepth longitudinal data collected among those experiencing and enacting adaptation. The results show that adaptation policies are more likely to be effective when they give individuals confidence in the continuity of their in-groups, enhance the self-esteem of these groups, and develop their sense of self-efficacy. These processes of identity formation and evolution are therefore central to individual and collective responses to climate risks.","[Barnett, Jon] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Graham, Sonia] Univ Wollongong, Sch Geog & Sustainable Commun, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Graham, Sonia] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Technol Ambientals, Bellaterra, Spain; [Quinn, Tara; Adger, W.

This article proposes transformative governance as a framework and methodology for addressing this question. It recognizes that the increased pace of climate change requires urgent and thorough adjustments to actual or expected climate change effects through a transformation of societies to increase their capacity to build sustainability. Our framework for transformative governance approach responds to this imperative and is based on three components: a theoretical framework for peaceful CCA governance derived from the fields of sustainability governance, political ecology and peacebuilding, second, a 'glocal' and bottom-up approach illustrated by two examples of cross border collaboration, that demonstrate peaceful CCA governance as necessarily glocal, thirdly a learning methodology that implies context-based, goal-oriented, pluralistic and interactive co-production of knowledge.

Design/methodology/approach - A climate change adaptation strategy tool (CCAST) with built-in GIS capability has been developed for agricultural industries. Development of the GIS functionality within CCAST includes the implementation of map projection, boundary allocation, interpolation and a graphical display of spatial data, hi total, 20 climatic and crop indices are computed alongside basic climate variables (rainfall and temperature) from downscaled global climate models at 1,062 sites across the state of New South Wales (NSW) located in eastern Australia. Findings - A case study in Australia is used to demonstrate use of this tool. This shows selecting suitable genotypes of wheat is a key adaptation strategy to mitigate the impacts of climate change on wheat cropping. It shows that spring wheat genotypes will become predominate, while the winter genotypes will only be viable in clearly defined areas where sufficient days of cool temperature exist for completion of vernalisation in a future warmer climate. Originality/value - CCAST integrates knowledge relevant to climate impact management in a stand-alone environment. It benefits from statistical analysis and GIS functionalities and provides many user-friendly GIS features to make it suitable for practitioners on the ground.","[Liu, De Li] Wagga Wagga Agr Inst, Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia; [Liu, De Li] EH Graham Ctr Agr Innovat, Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia; [Timbal, Bertrand] Bur Meteorol, Ctr Australian Weather & Climate Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Mo, Jianhua] Ind & Investment NSW, Primary Ind, Yanco, NSW, Australia; [Fairweather, Helen] Ind & Investment NSW, Dubbo, NSW, Australia; [Fairweather, Helen] Queensland Climate Change Ctr Excellence, Dept Environm & Resource Management, Deagon, Qld, Australia",Bureau of Meteorology - Australia; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); NSW Department of Primary Industries; NSW Department of Primary Industries,"Liu, DL (corresponding author), Wagga Wagga Agr Inst, Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia.",de.li.liu@industry.nsw.gov.au,", De Li Liu/Y-4656-2019","Liu, De Li/0000-0003-2574-1908; Fairweather, Helen/0000-0003-4208-2385",,,,,19,13,14,2,28,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

Existing research suggests that climate information is more likely to lead to adaptation actions when it is coproduced by researchers and policy makers because doing so increases the likelihood that the content of information is credible, salient, and legitimate. In this study, we explored how the coproduction process facilitated or hindered use of information from two climate adaptation projects in coastal New Hampshire. Based on 17 interviews and document review, we found that, contrary to expectations, highly engaged coproduction of knowledge may not be necessary due, in part, to preexisting trust among New Hampshire coastal municipalities, technical service providers, and researchers. However, we found in small towns with limited capacity, even the best climate knowledge is unlikely to be used without ongoing context-specific implementation assistance. Our research provides both practical recommendations for those actively advancing climate adaptation, as well as contributions to the undertheorized third phase of transdisciplinary research in which knowledge is translated to action.","[Levesque, Vanessa R.] Univ Southern Maine, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Gorham, ME 04038 USA; [Wake, Cameron] Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Wake, Cameron] Univ New Hampshire, Sustainabil Inst, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Peterson, Julia M.] Univ New Hampshire Cooperat Extens, New Hampshire Sea Grant, Lee, NH USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Levesque, VR (corresponding author), Univ Southern Maine, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Gorham, ME 04038 USA.",vanessa.r.levesque@maine.edu,,"Wake, Cameron/0000-0002-5961-5902","New Hampshire Sea Grant [NA14OAR4170083, R/RCE-3]",New Hampshire Sea Grant,"This research was funded by the New Hampshire Sea Grant number NA14OAR4170083, project number R/RCE-3.",,66,2,2,0,4,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,OAKLAND,"155 GRAND AVE, SUITE 400, OAKLAND, CA 94612-3758 USA",2325-1026,,,ELEMENTA-SCI ANTHROP,Elementa-Sci.

It looks specifically at the UK's Department for International Development (DFID) initiative called Action on Climate Today, a five-year programme that aims to support the mainstreaming of climate change adaptation into policy systems in five countries and ten locations in South Asia. This paper presents a theory-based approach to designing a monitoring system for the ACT programme that seeks to account for the programme's design and implementation complexities. It does so by providing an example for monitoring the causal processes and mechanisms that underpin the programme's theory of change. The paper highlights a systematic approach to context monitoring through periodic context assessments and evaluative indicators; the use of categorical indicators to capture a diverse portfolio of support; and a flexible results framework structured around the adoption and implementation of programme outputs into the targeted policy systems.","[McConnell, Jesse] 178 NE Basswood Circle, Lees Summit, MO 64064 USA",,"McConnell, J (corresponding author), 178 NE Basswood Circle, Lees Summit, MO 64064 USA.",mcconnell.jesse@gmail.com,,,,,,,63,5,5,2,7,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0149-7189,1873-7870,,EVAL PROGRAM PLANN,Eval.

The methods include: (1) analysis of secondary sources of information, (2) community collaboration and partnership building, (3) adaptation planning workshops, (4) adaptation plan development, (5) key informant and community review and (6) pilot adaptation actions. Vulnerability to climate change is assessed in the context of other nonclimatic factors-social, political, economic and environmental, already being experienced in communities and which influence how climate change is experienced and responded to. Key exposure-sensitivities and related adaptation options are identified in five sectors of a community: business and economy, culture and learning, health and wellbeing, subsistence harvesting, and transportation and infrastructure. This organization allows for focused discussions and the involvement of relevant stakeholders and experts from each sector. The methodology is applied in Paulatuk, an Inuit community located in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (ISR), Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada, and key findings are highlighted.

A systematic review of online databases has found at least 64 databases and tools online related to climate change adaptation. Despite the abundance of databases, this analysis reveals that the existing body of online databases generally lack the structure and mechanics to identify, extract, and synthesize both effective and ineffective climate change adaptation practices, projects, programs, and policies. Even relatively basic information, such as identification of projects' projected versus actual costs is absent, which are crucial decision-making criteria particularly in developing country contexts where resource constraints are significant. In this paper we evaluate these online tools with a focus on identifying features that potentially could contribute to knowledge sharing and successful exchange of climate change adaptation projects and practices within a developing country context. We conclude the paper with recommendations for how to improve efforts to communicate climate change research, such as more nuanced needs assessments of potential users of databases.

Interviews were conducted with orchardists cultivating apple orchards for at least 30 years in the Campania region (southern Italy) to obtain observations on climate, which were then compared with climate data analyses. Orchardists reported a more unpredictable seasonality and shifting climate conditions, perceived as beginning 20-30 years ago. Climate data analysis seems to corroborate orchardists' perceptions.

However, the understanding of how best to integrate CCA & M is limited despite the fact that there is an increasing interest, particularly in Southeast Asian countries, in achieving the integration. One such synergistic approach is to improve land-use with climate change consideration. This study aims to test this idea, conducting a pilot project with four local governments in the Silang-Sta. Rosa subwatershed of the Philippines, focusing on flood prevention that has strong spatial implications. The application of participatory watershed land-use management (PWLM), a systematic process with practical tools (e.g. scenario simulation, risk assessment), indicated that planned land-use conversion and projected climate change are likely to increase the intensity of flooding in the study area. Zoning enhancement is essential as a countermeasure. As one example, runoff neutral development measures would reduce the number of flood-affected people from approximately 226,410 to 183,349 in the future (year 2025), while preserving existing vegetation would prevent up to 528,142 tons of CO2 emissions. Illustrating the PWLM approach, this paper demonstrates the concrete use of scientific knowledge (i.e. flood hazard) for local planners to design climate change action.","[Endo, Isao; Kojima, Satoshi; Johnson, Brian A.; Scheyvens, Henry] Inst Global Environm Strategies, 2108-11 Kamiyamaguchi, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400115, Japan; [Magcale-Macandog, Damasa B.; Bragais, Milben A.; Macandog, Paula Beatrice M.] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Inst Biol Sci, College Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos,"Endo, I (corresponding author), Inst Global Environm Strategies, 2108-11 Kamiyamaguchi, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400115, Japan.",endo@iges.or.jp; demi_macandog@yahoo.com; kojima@iges.or.jp; johnson@iges.or.jp; mabragais@gmail.com; yulamacandog@gmail.com; scheyvens@iges.or.jp,,,"Ministry of the Environment, Japan; International Research Network for Low Carbon Societies","Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); International Research Network for Low Carbon Societies","This research was supported by the Ministry of the Environment, Japan and the International Research Network for Low Carbon Societies.

Federal health adaptation initiatives emphasize capacity building and gathering information to address general health, infectious disease and heat-related risks. Provincial and territorial adaptation is varied. Quebec is a leader in climate change adaptation, having a notably higher number of adaptation initiatives reported, addressing almost all risks posed by climate change in the province, and having implemented various adaptation types. Meanwhile, all other Canadian provinces and territories are in the early stages of health adaptation. Based on publically available information, reported adaptation also varies greatly by municipality. The six sampled Canadian regional health authorities (or equivalent) are not reporting any adaptation initiatives. We also find little relationship between the number of initiatives reported in the six sampled municipalities and their provinces, suggesting that municipalities are adapting (or not adapting) autonomously.","[Austin, Stephanie E.; Ford, James D.; Berrang-Ford, Lea; Araos, Malcolm] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada; [Parker, Stephen] Publ Hlth Agcy Canada, Ctr Food Borne Environm & Zoonot Infect Dis, Enter Surveillance & Populat Studies Div, Guelph, ON N1H 8J1, Canada; [Fleury, Manon D.] Publ Hlth Agcy Canada, Environm Issues Div, Guelph, ON N1H 8J1, Canada",McGill University; Public Health Agency of Canada; Public Health Agency of Canada,"Austin, SE (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Burnside Hall Bldg,Room 705, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada.",stephanie.austin@mail.mcgill.ca; james.ford@mcgill.ca; lea.berrangford@mcgill.ca; malcolm.araosegan@mail.mcgill.ca; stephen.parker@phac-aspc.gc.ca; Manon.D.Fleury@phac-aspc.gc.ca,"Ford, James/A-4284-2013","Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456; Austin, Stephanie E./0000-0002-9008-6666",Public Health Agency of Canada; CIHR; Dr. Lea Berrang-Ford's Trottier fellowship,Public Health Agency of Canada; CIHR(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Dr. Lea Berrang-Ford's Trottier fellowship,"The authors would like to acknowledge funding from the Public Health Agency of Canada, with the work also benefitting from support from CIHR and Dr. Lea Berrang-Ford's Trottier fellowship.",,100,39,39,2,38,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

By its geographical position, Nicaragua is one of the countries most affected by climate change, and coffee production is expected to vastly shrink in some critical areas, suitability being reduced by up to 40% in the country. This paper analyses farmer's perceptions and vulnerability indicators to find which indicators are linked to farmers' perceived capacity to adapt to climate change, paying special attention to the issue of whether farmers perceive they have any capacity at all to adapt. The analysis was conducted through a survey to 212 representative farmers jointly with an analysis of vulnerability indicators. A Heckman selection model was estimated to jointly analyse the probability of being able to cope with climate change and the level of adaptive capacity that farmers perceive. We have simulated different policy scenarios considering the sustainable development goals of United Nations in terms of poverty reduction and education concerns. We also analysed the effects of specific programs on education about climate change awareness. Finally, we extend our analysis to a geographical evaluation of the farmer's perceived vulnerability. The analysis shows that aspects such as farm size or education levels are relevant for modulating farmers' perceptions on their own adaptive capacity. Large farm managers find themselves more often able to cope with climate change impacts though they find their capacity to be limited. Farmers that could not rely on rainfall water for their plantations also reported being less able to cope with climate change impacts. Poverty was also found to be correlated to perceptions, as regions lower proportions of inhabitants under poverty levels showed higher levels of confidence in adaptive capacity.

This includes understanding the potential for 'natural' infrastructure (ecosystems and the biodiversity that underpins them) to reduce communities' vulnerability, alongside more traditional 'hard' infrastructure approaches. Here we present a spatially explicit global evaluation of the vulnerability of coastal-dwelling human populations to key climate change exposures and explore the potential for coastal ecosystems to help people adapt to climate change (ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA)). We find that mangroves and coral reefs are particularly well situated to help people cope with current weather extremes, a function that will only increase in importance as people adapt to climate change now and in coming decades. We find that around 30.9 million people living within 2km of the coast are highly vulnerable to tropical storms and sea-level rise (SLR). Mangroves and coral reefs overlap these threats to at least 5.3 and 3.4 million people, respectively, with substantial potential to dissipate storm surges and improve resilience against SLR effects. Significant co-benefits from mangroves also accrue, with 896 million metric tons of carbon stored in their soils and above- and below-ground biomass. Our framework offers a tool for prioritizing 'hotspots' of coastal EbA potential for further, national and local analyses to quantify risk reduction and, thereby, guide investment in coastal ecosystems to help people adapt to climate change. In doing so, it underscores the global role that conserving and restoring ecosystems can play in protecting human lives and livelihoods, as well as biodiversity, in the face of climate change.","[Jones, Holly P.] Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Biol Sci, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; [Jones, Holly P.] Northern Illinois Univ, Inst Study Environm Sustainabil & Energy, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; [Nickel, Barry] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Srebotnjak, Tanja] Harvey Mudd Coll, Hixon Ctr Sustainable Environm Design, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Turner, Will] Conservat Int, Global Strategy Div, Arlington, VA USA; [Gonzalez-Roglich, Mariano; Hole, David G.] Conservat Int, Betty & Gordon Moore Ctr Sci, Arlington, VA USA; [Zavaleta, Erika] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",Northern Illinois University; Northern Illinois University; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Claremont Colleges; Harvey Mudd College; Conservation International; Conservation International; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Jones, HP (corresponding author), Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Biol Sci, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.;Jones, HP (corresponding author), Northern Illinois Univ, Inst Study Environm Sustainabil & Energy, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.",hjones@niu.edu,,"Jones, Holly/0000-0002-5512-9958",,,,,84,8,8,2,30,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,MAY 29,2020,15,5,,,,,,,e0233005,10.1371/journal.pone.0233005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233005,,,17,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,LU1WS,32469978,"Green Published, gold, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000537552800038,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using Agricultural Census and climate data in a statistical model, we find that as temperature and precipitation increases agricultural commodity producers respond by reducing crop land and increasing pasture land. In addition, cattle stocking rate decreases as the summer Temperature-humidity Index (THI) increases and summer precipitation decreases. Using the statistical model with climate data from four General Circulation Models (GCMs), we project that land use shifts from cropping to grazing and the stocking rate declines, and these adaptations are more pronounced in the central and the southeast regions of the U.S. Controlling for other farm production variables, crop land decreases by 6 % and pasture land increases by 33 % from the baseline. Correspondingly, the associated economic impact due to adaptation is around -14 and 29 million dollars to crop producers and pasture producers by the end of this century, respectively. The national and regional results have implications for farm programs and subsidy policies.","[Mu, Jianhong E.; McCarl, Bruce A.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77840 USA; [Wein, Anne M.] US Geol Survey, Western Geog Sci Ctr, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Mu, JHE (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77840 USA.",mujh1024@gmail.com,"McCarl, Bruce A/E-9445-2011",,,,,,36,38,38,2,47,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

However, understanding of the effectiveness of these responses for adaptation to climate change across the diversity of African contexts is still limited. Despite high reliance on indigenous knowledge (IK) and local knowledge (LK) for climate adaptation by African communities, potential of IK and LK to contribute to adaptation through reducing climate risk or supporting transformative adaptation responses is yet to be established. Here, we assess the influence of IK and LK for the implementation of water sector adaptation responses in Africa to better understand the relationship between responses to climate change and indigenous and local knowledge systems. Eighteen (18) water adaptation response types were identified from the academic literature through the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative (GAMI) and intended nationally determined contributions (iNDCs) for selected African countries. Southern, West, and East Africa show relatively high evidence of the influence of IK and LK on the implementation of water adaptation responses, while North and Central Africa show lower evidence. At country level, Zimbabwe displays the highest evidence (77.8%) followed by Ghana (53.6%), Kenya (46.2%), and South Africa (31.3%). Irrigation, rainwater harvesting, water conservation, and ecosystem-based measures, mainly agroforestry, were the most implemented measures across Africa. These were mainly household and individual measures influenced by local and indigenous knowledge. Adaptation responses with IK and LK influence recorded higher evidence of risk reduction compared to responses without IK and LK. Analysis of iNDCs shows the most implemented water adaptation actions in academic literature are consistent with water sector adaptation targets set by most African governments. Yet only 10.4% of the African governments included IK and LK in adaptation planning in the iNDCs. This study recommends a coordinated approach to adaptation that integrates multiple knowledge sources, including IK and LK, to ensure sustainability of both current and potential water adaptation measures in Africa.","[Zvobgo, Luckson; Johnston, Peter] Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Climate Syst Anal Grp CSAG, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [Williams, Portia Adade] CSIR Sci & Technol Policy Res Inst, Accra, Ghana; [Zvobgo, Luckson; Trisos, Christopher H.; Simpson, Nicholas P.] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa; [Trisos, Christopher H.] Univ Cape Town, Ctr Stat Ecol Environm & Conservat, Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Zvobgo, L (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Climate Syst Anal Grp CSAG, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa.;Zvobgo, L (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa.",zvobgoluckson@gmail.com,"Simpson, Nick/AAC-4578-2022; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Simpson, Nick/0000-0002-9041-982X; Trisos, Christopher/0000-0002-5854-1489; Zvobgo, Luckson/0000-0003-3400-8003; Williams, Portia/0000-0002-5919-3930",,,,,80,4,4,5,15,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",1862-4065,1862-4057,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

The Brokpa pastoral nomads mainly depend upon livestock, like yak, yak-cattle hybrid etc, rearing for their livelihood. They perceived that season cycle has been changed in lower and mid altitude. They also perceived that onset of summer is getting started 1-2 month(s) earlier than before and also extended by 2-3 months. Therefore, Brokpa pastoral nomads of Arunachal Pradesh have expanded their migration duration by 2-3 months in searching of congenial environment for their livestock specially yak and yak-cattle hybrid.

Resettlement as climate change adaptation is a developing concept, with minimal guidelines and academic literature on the topic. Thus, this review expands beyond climate change, considering three literature themes surrounding resettlement: (1) climate change, (2) hazard and natural disasters (i.e. floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes), and (3) economic development (i.e. dam construction and natural resource extraction). The review extracts successful resettlement planning and approaches, as well as the lessons learned, to identify five principles for resettlement in a climate change context: Proactivity, Communication and Participation, Permanence, Compensation, and Livelihood Protection. The results of the analysis suggest five principles that can be used as a guideline for implementing resettlement as climate change adaptation for low-income and informal communities in less developed nations. Ultimately, these recommendations can be used to assess the appropriateness and feasibility of employing resettlement as managed retreat in less developed nations.","[Tadgell, Anne; Doberstein, Brent; Mortsch, Linda] Univ Waterloo, Fac Environm Studies, Dept Geog, 200 Univ Ave, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Tadgell, A (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Fac Environm Studies, Dept Geog, 200 Univ Ave, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",aetadgel@uwaterloo.ca,,,International Development Research Centre; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council,International Development Research Centre; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"This work was supported by the International Development Research Centre, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.",,67,22,22,2,46,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

To accomplish these aims, a multiple regression analysis was performed, and the severity index (SI) was estimated to measure perceived vulnerability context. The results revealed that age, education level, farm income, farm experience, limited access to agricultural extension, lack of credit facilities, limited access to agricultural markets, and farm size are factors which have significant impacts on adaptation practices. The value of the SI suggests that farmers have favourable attitudes towards climate change adaptation and they are agreeable to addressing climate change issues through appropriate adaptation strategies. However, the study found several adaptation barriers that hinder farmers from implementing climate change adaptation policies. It is realized that at present, no specific policy in Malaysia seeks to counter the impacts of climate change on individual sectors and their productivity. Therefore, the findings of this study will assist policymakers to make an appropriate policy framework considering most suitable adaptation strategies to overcome all the barriers associated with adaptation practices to tackle the adverse effects of climate change in Malaysian agriculture sector.

However, gaps remain in understanding how households' adaptive capacities can become uneven. This paper investigates how development transitions-such as the recent adoption of 'green revolution' agricultural policies throughout sub-Saharan Africa-intersect with cross-scale social-environmental processes to unevenly shape smallholders' adaptive capacities and adaptation pathways. Drawing on quantitative and qualitative material from a multi-season study in Rwanda, we investigate smallholder adaptation processes amid a suite of rural development interventions. Our study finds that adaptive capacities arise differentially across livelihood groups in the context of evolving environmental, social, and political economic processes. We show how social institutions play key roles in shaping differential adaptation pathways by enabling and/or constraining opportunities for smallholders to adapt livelihood and land use strategies. Specifically, Rwanda's Crop Intensification Program enables some wealthier households to adapt livelihoods by generating income through commercial agriculture. At the same time, deactivation of local risk management institutions has diminished climate risk management options for most households. To build and employ alternate livelihood practices such as commercial agriculture and planting woodlots for charcoal production, smallholders must negotiate new institutions, a prerequisite for which is access to capitals (land, labor, and nonfarm income). Those without entitlements to these are pulled deeper into poverty with each successive climatic shock. This illustrates that adaptive capacity is not a static, quantifiable entity that exists in households. We argue that reconceptualizing adaptive capacity as a dynamic, social-environmental process that emerges in places can help clarify complex linkages among development policies, livelihoods, and adaptation pathways. To ensure more equitable and climate-resilient agricultural development, we stress the need to reformulate policies with careful attention to how power structures and entrenched social inequalities can lead to smallholders' uneven capacities to adapt to climate change.

Nowhere will these challenges be greater than in the developing world where often weak institutions and governance systems struggle to deal with mounting pressures from population growth, inadequate infrastructure, and diminishing or already depleted natural resources. This article synthesizes the many global climate change and other anthropogenic threats to coastal ecosystems and draws on lessons and good practices from global experience in integrated coastal management (ICM) that can be transferred to coastal adaptation to these challenges. The case is made that the process and best practices of ICM are not radically changed by applying a climate lens. For the most part, the good practices of planning and implementation coastal management measures apply equally to climate change as they do to other coastal issues. However, there are some new and important considerations that enter into planning and decision-making with respect to climate change. These considerations include the need for an even greater emphasis on nature-based coastal protection strategies and measures, more pronounced issues of uncertainty in decision-making, the need for a longer planning horizon, and the importance of including in the decision-making equation opportunities to mitigate the sources of climate change with adaptation measures.","[Tobey, James; Rubinoff, Pamela; Robadue, Donald, Jr.; Ricci, Glen] Univ Rhode Isl, Coastal Resources Ctr, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA; [Volk, Richard] US Agcy Int Dev, Bur Econ Growth Agr & Trade, Water & Coastal Resources Team, Washington, DC 20523 USA; [Furlow, John] US Agcy Int Dev, Bur Econ Growth Agr & Trade, Global Climate Change Team, Washington, DC 20523 USA; [Anderson, Glen] Int Resources Grp, Washington, DC USA",University of Rhode Island; United States Agency for International Development (USAID); United States Agency for International Development (USAID),"Tobey, J (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Coastal Resources Ctr, 220 S Ferry Rd, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA.",tobey@crc.uri.edu,"Robadue, Don/AID-4432-2022","Robadue, Don/0000-0001-9799-9620",,,,,21,61,62,3,31,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0892-0753,1521-0421,,COAST MANAGE,Coast.

Drawing on ethnographic research with Indigenous Maori women in Aotearoa New Zealand, this paper provides empirical evidence that subjectivity-mediated power dynamics operating within Indigenous societies (at the individual and household scale) are important determinants of vulnerability and adaptation which should be considered in both scholarship and policy. Using an intersectional framework, I demonstrate how different Maori women and their whanau (families) live, cope with, and adapt to the embodied physical and emotional health effects of climate change in radically different ways because of their subject positionings, even though they belong to the same community, hapu (sub-tribe), or iwi (tribe). In underlining these heterogenous experiences, I provide an avenue for reconsidering how climate adaptation scholarship, policies, and practices might better engage with the complex, amorphous realities within Maori and other Indigenous communities. I argue it is possible to develop more inclusive, tailored, and sustainable adaptation that considers divergent vulnerabilities and adaptive capacities within Indigenous communities, groups, and societies and supports customised vulnerability-reduction strategies.","[Johnson, Danielle Emma; Fisher, Karen; Parsons, Meg] Waipapa Taumata Rau Univ Auckland, Kura Matai Taiao Sch Environm, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand",,"Johnson, DE (corresponding author), Waipapa Taumata Rau Univ Auckland, Kura Matai Taiao Sch Environm, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",danielle.johnson@auckland.ac.nz; k.fisher@auckland.ac.nz; meg.parsons@auckland.ac.nz,"Fisher, Karen/HJH-3615-2023; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022; Parsons, Meg/C-2405-2019","Johnson, Danielle/0000-0001-5402-9229; Parsons, Meg/0000-0001-8721-659X",University of Auckland; Royal Geographical Society [FSPA 01/19],University of Auckland; Royal Geographical Society,This research was funded by The University of Auckland (Doctoral Scholarship) and The Royal Geographical Society with IBG (Frederik Soddy Postgraduate Award number FSPA 01/19).,,354,0,0,3,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2022,14,9,,,,,,,5452,10.3390/su14095452,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14095452,,,40,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1F5VG,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000795236000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate change has already affected crop yields in some countries, and these effects are expected to continue. Identification of weather-related yield-limiting conditions and development of strategies for agricultural adaptation to climate change is essential to mitigate food security concerns. Here we used machine learning on US soybean yield data, collected from cultivar trials conducted in 27 states from 2007 to 2016, to examine crop sensitivity to varying in-season weather conditions. We identified the month-specific negative effect of drought via increased water vapor pressure deficit. Excluding Texas and Mississippi, where later sowing increased yield, sowing 12 days earlier than what was practiced during this decade across the US would have resulted in 10% greater total yield and a cumulative monetary gain of ca. US$9 billion. Our data show the substantial nation-and region-specific yield and monetary effects of adjusting sowing timing and highlight the importance of continuously quantifying and adapting to climate change. The magnitude of impact estimated in our study suggest that policy makers (e.g., federal crop insurance) and laggards (farmers that are slow to adopt) that fail to acknowledge and adapt to climate change will impact the national food security and economy of the US.","[Mourtzinis, Spyridon; Conley, Shawn P.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agron, 1575 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Specht, James E.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agron, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Mourtzinis, S (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agron, 1575 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",agstat001@gmail.com,,"Conley, Shawn/0000-0002-8413-1088",,,,,29,33,34,3,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,FEB 26,2019,9,,,,,,,,2800,10.1038/s41598-019-38971-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-38971-3,,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,HM7ZT,30808953,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000459698900061,View Full Record in Web of Science

Comprehensively and consistently assessing possible management adaptation options requires a clear definition of a multi-criteria evaluation framework incorporating information about the relative importance of often competing criteria or objectives. Such a framework is often missing from climate change adaptation evaluation, with adaptation priorities and plans often developed without direct reference to the key objectives of management. We used the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to develop a weighted hierarchy of objectives in four south-eastern Australian fisheries. The developed hierarchy included fisheries management objectives routinely articulated in policy and management documents, those that may underpin effective adaptation and adaptation planning, and objectives likely to contribute to ongoing adaptive capacity and resilience of fisheries and associated communities. Results of an interactive survey of managers, researchers and commercial and recreational fishers yielded average weightings of objectives that were quite consistent across the four fisheries, with a very strong preference for ensuring that adaptations support environmental and ecological values, particularly through sustaining the harvested population. However, differences between stakeholder groups were more marked, with economic objectives considered more important by commercial fishers, and social objectives by recreational fishers, than by other groups. This suggests the possibility of conflicts between groups when determining appropriate adaptation strategies, as alternative strategies will have different economic and social outcomes even if achieving comparable environmental outcomes.","[Jennings, Sarah; Hall-Aspland, Sophie; Le Bouhellec, Bastien] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Private Bag 84, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Jennings, Sarah; Pascoe, Sean; Pecl, Gretta] Ctr Marine Socioecol, Private Bag 129, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Pascoe, Sean; Norman-Lopez, Ana] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, POB 2583, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Hall-Aspland, Sophie; Pecl, Gretta] Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Private Bag 129, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Sullivan, Andrew] Fish Focus Consulting, POB 804, Sandy Bay, Tas 7006, Australia",University of Tasmania; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Tasmania,"Jennings, S (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Private Bag 84, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.;Jennings, S (corresponding author), Ctr Marine Socioecol, Private Bag 129, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",sarah.jennings@utas.edu.au,"Pecl, Gretta/D-7267-2011; Pascoe, Sean/D-9710-2011","Pecl, Gretta/0000-0003-0192-4339; Pascoe, Sean/0000-0001-6581-2649",ARC Future Fellowship; Fisheries Research and Development Corporation under the South East Australia Program (SEAP); CSIRO Wealth from Oceans Flagship,ARC Future Fellowship(Australian Research Council); Fisheries Research and Development Corporation under the South East Australia Program (SEAP); CSIRO Wealth from Oceans Flagship(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),"The project was funded by the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation under the South East Australia Program (SEAP) and the CSIRO Wealth from Oceans Flagship.

Here, we present a meta-analysis of aggregate adaptation costs in developing countries, across three roughly homogeneous groups of estimates, i.e. national plan-based, bottom-up science-based, and global top-down estimates. We show that the level of global warming, a country's economic status, and methodology applied, are the main determinants for the estimated costs of adaptation. Not surprisingly, adaptation costs are much higher at high levels of global warming by 2050 and 2100, diverging from low levels of warming from the 2030s. Consequently, strong global mitigation action could reduce the adaptation costs by three quarters by 2100. Next, adaptation costs are higher for high-income countries in absolute dollar value, but costs are higher relative to gross domestic product for low-income countries. The integrated assessment model based estimates are at the higher end of the range at the global scale, but the estimates based on the sectoral impacts aggregation approach are higher in case of bottom-up estimates. Regardless of the methodology applied, current climate finance pledges of USD100 billion by 2020 - for both mitigation and adaptation - would fall far short of estimated global adaptation costs.","[Chapagain, Dipesh; Schaeffer, Michiel; D'haen, Sarah] Climate Analyt, Berlin, Germany; [Baarsch, Florent] Int Fund Agr Dev, Rome, Italy; [Baarsch, Florent] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Baarsch, Florent] CESIfo, Munich, Germany; [Schaeffer, Michiel] Wageningen Univ, Environm Syst Anal Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Ifo Institut; Wageningen University & Research,"Chapagain, D (corresponding author), Climate Analyt, Berlin, Germany.",dipesh.env@gmail.com,"Chapagain, Dipesh/AAW-9156-2020","Chapagain, Dipesh/0000-0002-2418-6343","International Climate Protection Fellowship Programme of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB)","International Climate Protection Fellowship Programme of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB)","This research was sponsored by the International Climate Protection Fellowship Programme of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation with financial support from the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB).

Under the 2035 scenario, the city can still achieve its development goals despite the change in land suitability and increase in population.","[Abella, Gella Patria L.] Cent Luzon State Univ, Sci City Of Munoz 3120, Nueva Ecija, Philippines; [Lansigan, Felino; Tubay, Jerrold] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines",Central Luzon State University; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos,"Abella, GPL (corresponding author), Cent Luzon State Univ, Sci City Of Munoz 3120, Nueva Ecija, Philippines.",gplabella@clsu.edu.ph,"Tubay, Jerrold Maranan/G-4039-2017","Tubay, Jerrold Maranan/0000-0003-4826-1966; Abella, Gella Patria/0000-0003-0917-4755",Commission on Higher Education; Faculty Development Program Phase II [2012-080006],Commission on Higher Education; Faculty Development Program Phase II,"The authors would like to express their humble gratitude to: (1) the Commission on Higher Education for the research grant, Faculty Development Program Phase II 2012-080006, awarded to the corresponding author; (2) employees of the city government of San Jose for providing the necessary information and documents; and (3) farmer respondents for allowing their farms to be part of the study.",,24,2,2,0,2,"UNIV INDONESIA, FAC ENGINEERING",DEPOK,"KAMPUS UI DEPOK, DEPOK, 16424, INDONESIA",2086-9614,2087-2100,,INT J TECHNOL,Int.

Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is being promoted to facilitate climate change adaptation and mitigation. While there is evidence that CSA supports smallholders' adaption to climate change, the rate of CSA adoption remains low, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Previous studies have explained the low adoption based on generic factors such as farm, farmer, institutional and location characteristics, yet little is known about the role of farmers' cognitive traits. This study investigates the influence of farmer entrepreneurial orientation, a cognitive trait reflecting a farmer's innovativeness, proactiveness and propensity to take risks. We use data from smallholder potato farmers in Kenya and estimate a set of multivariate probit models to analyse the adoption decisions. Results show that risk-taking positively influences the adoption of irrigation, changing cultivation calendar, use of certified seed, crop rotation and soil testing. Proactiveness is positively related to the use of irrigation, changing the cultivation calendar and use of certified seed, while it is negatively related to intercropping. Contrary to our hypothesis that innovative farmers are more likely to adopt CSA practices, we find a negative relation between innovativeness and the use of certified seed. After categorizing CSA practices based on the main resources required, we find that risk-taking is positively associated with the adoption of practices that require high intensity of skilled labour and financial resources. Innovativeness is negatively associated with practices that require high intensity of financial resources. Lastly, we find proactiveness to be positively associated with the adoption of finance-intensive practices but negatively associated with unskilled-labour-intensive practices. These findings imply, first, that development practitioners should consider the interrelations among CSA practices and farmer entrepreneurial orientation in designing development interventions. Second, policymakers need to create an environment conducive to farmer entrepreneurship as an indirect way to support the adoption of appropriate CSA practices.","[Kangogo, Daniel; Bijman, Jos] Wageningen Univ & Res, Business Management & Org, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Dentoni, Domenico] Univ Montpellier, Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier Res Management, Montpellier, France",Wageningen University & Research; Montpellier Business School; Universite de Montpellier,"Kangogo, D (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Business Management & Org, Wageningen, Netherlands.",kangogodan@yahoo.com,,,"Food Security programme of the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Kenya through the 3R (Robust, Resilient and Reliable) research project","Food Security programme of the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Kenya through the 3R (Robust, Resilient and Reliable) research project","Financial support for this research was provided by the Food Security programme of the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Kenya through the 3R (Robust, Resilient and Reliable) research project.

It describes how most of the needed adaptations in the next few decades can be integrated into existing government functions, investments, regulations, and agencies. It also considers why most such measures are unlikely to be implemented-because of either the lack of capacity within urban governments or their unwillingness to address the infrastructure and service needs of their low-income populations. Most urban centers in the Global South also have very large deficits in the basic infrastructure and services that are needed for resilience to climate change impacts. The article also considers how the policies and practices of higher levels of government and international agencies need to change if the much needed adaptive capacity is to be built in urban areas.

At the same time, extreme climate-related weather events are undermining the health ministry's capacity to support people to live long and full lives. This paper describes existing climate change-related challenges confronting Myanmar's health sector and explores opportunities for the health ministry to influence other health determining sectors, including disaster risk reduction. It was a qualitative study, drawing on semi-structured interviews with government officials from health, social welfare, environment and rural development, as well as with personnel from international and national NGOs and organizations. Interview data was triangulated with policy documents and on-the-ground research. The research found that Myanmar's governance structures are changing rapidly and that responding to disasters is an urgent priority that has over-shadowed planned long-term adaptation to climate change. Furthermore, poor coordination across scales and sectors inhibits effective adaptation and disaster risk reduction. In this context, the health ministry, already involved in disaster response, is well placed to draw on its vertical and horizontal penetration to seize an existing window of opportunity and improve climate change responses and disaster risk reduction by taking on a coordinating role.","[Gilfillan, Daniel] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Gilfillan, D (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, 48 Linnaeus Way, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",daniel.gilfillan@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,64,1,1,1,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Green infrastructure has been identified as a critical strategy for stormwater management and flooding mitigation as well as for climate change adaptation. Climate science plays an important role in understanding a range of climate change impacts and the effects of green infrastructure for climate change planning. Nevertheless, a lack of down-scaled climate change data and place-based assessment has discouraged local communities to pursue further climate change plans. This study proposed a transdisciplinary planning framework assessing the effects of detention in mitigating climate change-induced flooding, using a case in the Charles River watershed, Massachusetts, USA. Derived from a climate sensitivity test in the watershed, 36 climate change conditions were modeled using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and compared to IPCC scenarios. Statistical analyses revealed that detention is more efficient in reducing flooding hazards in low and moderate emission scenarios than those at high emission scenarios. A range of extra land area designated for detention would be needed for mitigating floods under various climate change scenarios. Planning implications include the needs for effective siting of detention areas combined with soil conservation in watershed planning, innovations in adaptive land planning and urban design, and a call for an integration of climate science and hydrological assessment in the transdisciplinary planning processes to better inform and facilitate decision-making using green infrastructure for climate change adaptation in local communities.","[Cheng, Chingwen] Arizona State Univ, Design Sch, POB 871605, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Yang, Y.

We highlight both the risks arising from inadequate adaptation to the impacts of climate change, and the opportunities presented by playing a role in the global response to adaptation. We demonstrate that the success, or not, of adaptation to the impacts of climate change will be relevant to both the underwriting and investment operations of (re) insurance companies. In the short term, climate change will affect underwriting practices by necessitating risk quantification approaches that include a forward-looking view of risk that is not purely grounded in historical experience. In the longer term, insufficient adaptation in areas of rising risk could threaten the concept of insurability itself, by limiting the availability and affordability of private insurance coverage. Furthermore, we demonstrate that activities that incentivise and enable adaptation not only give rise to commercial opportunities and reputational reward, but are increasingly necessary for the sustainability of the industry.

Business organizations face highly diverse risks which they have to recognize, reflect on and handle. Climate change and its impacts clarify the need for managing overall system risk. Research has shown that climate vulnerability of business organizations in the German food industry is characterized by impacts that, in particular, affect business organizations indirectly. Indirect climate change caused impacts are complex, uncertain and characterized by a high degree of unpredictability. They focus on the derived social, ecological, economic and cultural consequences of the direct physical impacts from a worldwide perspective. This paper shows that introducing resilience thinking helps to identify strategic risks and opportunities coping with climate change caused impacts in sense of corporate climate adaptation strategies. Furthermore, it is shown from a strategic management perspective that mitigation is a profound element of long term adaptation strategies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, few recommendations exist on how to diversify farm systems in ways that best fit the agroecological and socioeconomic challenges farmers face. Farmers' ability to adopt diversification strategies is often stymied by their aversion to risk, loss of local knowledge, and limited access to agronomic and market information, this is especially the case for smallholders. We outline seven steps on how practitioners and researchers in agricultural development can work with farmers in decision-making about on-farm diversification of cropping, pasture, and agroforestry systems while taking into account these constraints. These seven steps are relevant for all types of farmers but particularly for smallholders in tropical and subtropical regions. It is these farmers who are usually most vulnerable to climate change and who are, subsequently, often the target of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) interventions. Networks of agricultural innovation provide an enabling environment for on-farm diversification. These networks connect farmers and farmer organizations with local, national, or international private companies, public organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and research institutes. These actors can work with farmers to develop diversified production systems incorporating both high-value crops and traditional food production systems. These diversified farm systems with both food and cash crops act as a safety net in the event of price fluctuations or other disruptions to crop value chains. In this way, farmers can adapt their farm systems to climate change in ways that provide greater food security and improved income.","[van Zonneveld, Maarten] World Vegetable Ctr, Shanhua, Taiwan; [van Zonneveld, Maarten; Turmel, Marie-Soleil] Costa Rica Off, Biovers Int, Turrialba, Costa Rica; [Turmel, Marie-Soleil] Catholic Relief Serv, Baltimore, MD USA; [Hellin, Jon] Int Rice Res Inst, Sustainable Impact Platform, Los Banos, Philippines",Alliance; Bioversity International; CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI),"van Zonneveld, M (corresponding author), World Vegetable Ctr, Shanhua, Taiwan.;van Zonneveld, M (corresponding author), Costa Rica Off, Biovers Int, Turrialba, Costa Rica.",maarten.vanzonneveld@worldveg.org,,"Hellin, Jon/0000-0002-2686-8065","Hivos; CGIAR Research Programs Humidtropics, and Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR Fund; Republic of China (Taiwan); UK aid from the UK government; United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR); Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development of Germany","Hivos; CGIAR Research Programs Humidtropics, and Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); CGIAR Fund(CGIAR); Republic of China (Taiwan); UK aid from the UK government(CGIAR); United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)CGIAR); Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)(Australian Ctr Intl Agr Res); Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development of Germany","This study was supported by Hivos, the Central American research platform on Production and Conservation in Partnership (PCP) and the CGIAR Research Programs Humidtropics, and Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), with support from CGIAR Fund and Donors.

The case study indicates that adaptation and development interact better when policies are designed to integrate different needs, and that existing processes like the National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPA) can help to mainstream adaptation into development policies while keeping objectives separate. The assessment shows that synergies between development and adaptation can be promoted to increase adaptive capacity and implement adaptation measures. A Sustainable Development Policies and Measures (SD-PAM) mechanism, similar to the one more commonly discussed for mitigation, can also be used to identify, finance and monitor adaptation through development activities. NAPAs can further facilitate the identification of common resources, leverage mechanisms and activities required for success in adaptation and development interventions. Adaptation can be integrated into development interventions, as well as into institutional arrangements, resource management and legal frameworks. Integration of adaptation can also support sustainable development through a systemic consideration of the assumptions and interventions in development policies. The implementation of adaptation could be advanced through targeted development interventions that create traceable adaptation benefits through mechanisms that incentivize and support sustainable development policies and measures.","[Hoffmaister, Juan P.; Roman, Mikael] Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm Environment Institute,"Hoffmaister, JP (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm, Sweden.",juan.hoffmaister@me.com,,,,,,,25,8,8,0,35,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The adoption of climate change adaptation measures at the building scale aims at limiting heating and cooling demands. In previous studies on adaptation measures little attention has been paid to lightweight semi-portable buildings, which are increasingly used to temporarily house the growing number of small households (1-2 persons) in peripheral and derelict areas. In this paper the impact of passive climate adaptation measures and building orientation on heating and cooling demands is assessed for a detached, lightweight, semi-portable residential building by means of building energy simulations (BES), considering two climate scenarios for the Netherlands: current climate and a future climate (2050). The results show that the most efficient adaptation measure consists in a combination of exterior solar shading and an increase of thermal resistance of the building envelope, which reduces the annual heating and cooling demand-averaged over eight building orientations - by 11% for the current climate and 15% for the future climate. The impact of building orientation varies according to the climate scenario. Compared to the average over the eight orientations considered, the annual cooling demand for a single orientation varies between about -31% and +22% and between about -24% and +18% for the current and future climate, respectively. For the case without adaptation measures, optimizing the building orientation leads to annual total energy savings of about 4% for the current and 3% for the future climate.","[Vasaturo, Raffaele; van Hooff, Twan; Kalkman, Ivo; Blocken, Bert; van Wesemael, Pieter] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Built Environm, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [van Hooff, Twan; Blocken, Bert] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Civil Engn, Leuven, Belgium",Eindhoven University of Technology; KU Leuven,"Vasaturo, R (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Built Environm, Eindhoven, Netherlands.",r.vasaturo@tue.nl,"Blocken, Bert/A-1880-2009; van Hooff, Twan/A-4695-2013","Blocken, Bert/0000-0003-2935-9562; van Hooff, Twan/0000-0002-7811-2745","PhD Impulse Program of the Eindhoven University of Technology; construction company Heijmans B.V., the Netherlands; Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) [FWO 12R9718N]","PhD Impulse Program of the Eindhoven University of Technology; construction company Heijmans B.V., the Netherlands(Netherlands Government); Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)(FWO)","This research was financially supported by the PhD Impulse Program of the Eindhoven University of Technology, in collaboration with the construction company Heijmans B.V., the Netherlands.

However, only a minority of European cities has an approved climate adaptation plan by now. To support stakeholder dialogue and decision-making processes in climate adaptation planning, a detailed spatial information and evidence base in terms of a climate impact assessment is needed. This article aims to compare the climate impact assessment done in the context of two regional climate change adaptation planning processes in a Dutch and a German region. To do so, a comparison of guidelines and handbooks, methodological approaches, available data, and resulting maps and products is conducted. Similarities and differences between the two approaches with a particular focus on the input and output of such analysis are identified and both processes are assessed using a set of previously defined quality criteria. Both studies apply a similar conceptualisation of climate impacts and focus strongly on issues concerning their visualisation and communication. At the same time, the methods of how climate impacts are calculated and mapped are quite different. The discussion and conclusion section highlights the need to systematically consider climatic and socio-economic changes when carrying out a climate impact assessment, to focus on a strong visualisation of results for different stakeholder groups, and to link the results to planning processes and especially funding opportunities.","[Wright, Juliane; Schmitt, Joerg Peter; Greiving, Stefan] TU Dortmund Univ, Fac Spatial Planning, Dortmund, Germany; [Flacke, Johannes] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat, Enschede, Netherlands; [Schultze, Juergen] TU Dortmund Univ, Social Res Ctr, Dortmund, Germany",Dortmund University of Technology; University of Twente; Dortmund University of Technology,"Wright, J (corresponding author), TU Dortmund Univ, Fac Spatial Planning, Dortmund, Germany.",juliane.wright@tu-dortmund.de; j.flacke@utwente.nl; joerg.schmitt@tu-dortmund.de; juergen.schultze@tu-dortmund.de; stefan.greiving@tu-dortmund.de,"Flacke, Johannes/C-9941-2013","Flacke, Johannes/0000-0001-8906-7719; Schultze, Jurgen/0000-0003-2038-0381",,,,,39,1,1,0,4,COGITATIO PRESS,LISBON,"RUA FIALHO ALMEIDA 14, 2 ESQ, LISBON, 1070-129, PORTUGAL",2183-7635,,,URBAN PLAN,Urban Plan.,,2021,6,3,,,,,306,320,,10.17645/up.v6i3.4269,http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/up.v6i3.4269,,,15,Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Urban Studies,WI7BD,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000708511600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

But critics argue that IWRM is often less 'integrated' in practice, raising concerns over inter-sectoral coherence between implementing institutions. One increasingly significant aspect of IWRM is adaptation to climate change-related risks, including threats from flooding, which are particularly salient in England. Although multiple institutional mechanisms exist for flood risk management (FRM), their coherence remains a critical question for national adaptation. This paper therefore (1) maps the multi-level institutional frameworks determining both IWRM and FRM in England; (2) examines their interaction via various inter-institutional coordinating mechanisms; and (3) assesses the degree of coherence. The analysis suggests that cognate EU strategic objectives for flood risk assessment demonstrate relatively high vertical and horizontal coherence with river basin planning. However, there is less coherence with flood risk requirements for land-use planning and national flood protection objectives. Overall, this complex governance arrangement actually demonstrates de-coherence over time due to ongoing institutional fragmentation. Recommendations for increasing IWRM coherence in England or re-coherence based on greater spatial planning and coordination of water-use and land-use strategies are proposed.","[Benson, David] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England; [Benson, David] Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England; [Lorenzoni, Irene] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Lorenzoni, Irene] Univ East Anglia, Sci Soc & Sustainabil Grp 3S, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of Exeter; University of Exeter; University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia,"Benson, D (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England.;Benson, D (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England.",d.i.benson@exeter.ac.uk; i.lorenzoni@uea.ac.uk,,,Leverhulme Trust (International Network Scheme); University of Exeter SSIS Discretionary Fund,Leverhulme Trust (International Network Scheme); University of Exeter SSIS Discretionary Fund,The authors acknowledge the support of the Leverhulme Trust (International Network Scheme) and the University of Exeter SSIS Discretionary Fund in researching this article.,,48,21,21,2,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the effect of watershed management on selected soil properties, wheat grain yield, farmers income and climate change adaptation strategies in the northwest highlands of Ethiopia. Two treated and untreated watersheds were selected, and data were collected at representative locations (upper, middle and lower slope positions) in both watersheds. Soil samples were collected to determine the soil physical and chemical properties. Wheat grain yield was collected in the field. To identify climate change adaptation strategies and to evaluate households' income field survey and questionnaire were administered using random sampling technique. The result shows that total nitrogen, available phosphorous, soil organic matter, soil organic carbon, soil reaction and moisture contents were significantly affected positively by watershed management. In the treated watershed, the wheat crop yield was increased by 33.2% and household income increased by 13.77% due to the watershed management interventions. The communities were practicing planting multipurpose trees and shrubs on their farmland, practicing irrigation development, implementing different soil and water conservation practices on their farms and communal lands, intensifying crop productivity and destocking in the two watersheds to adapt climate change. In this regard, this watershed management approach should be up-scaled to other areas and research work has to be extended to show the effect of watershed management on climate change adaptation.","[Getie, Melkam Alewoye] Wollo Univ, Coll Agr, Dessie, Ethiopia; [Legesse, Solomon Addisu; Mekonnen, Mulatie] Bahir Dar Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, POB 5501, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Aschalew, Abebe] Haraomaya Univ, Sch Nat Resources Management & Environm Sci, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia",Bahir Dar University,"Legesse, SA (corresponding author), Bahir Dar Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, POB 5501, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia.",melkama@wu.edu.et; soladd2000@yahoo.com; mulatiemekonneng@gmail.com; abebe_aschalew@yahoo.com,"Legesse, Solomon/AAL-7905-2021","/0000-0003-1903-7981; Addisu, Solomon/0000-0002-2555-4478","Bahir Dar University; Bureau of forest, environment and climate change","Bahir Dar University; Bureau of forest, environment and climate change","Funded by Bahir Dar University and Bureau of forest, environment and climate change.",,28,10,10,1,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2509-9426,2509-9434,,EARTH SYST ENVIRON,Earth Syst.

Their consideration in some of the main global frameworks such as the IPCC report or the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction has raised additional attention. However, these approaches are still more associated with rural than urban areas, although many urban areas face a high risk of natural hazards and the benefits of ecosystem-based measures to reduce it have already been proven in different cities. A successful implementation of ecosystem-based approaches in urban areas is highly complex. Using the city of Rio de Janeiro as case study, we first examine on the municipality level the responsibilities of the different institutions involved in landslide risk reduction and their technical and organizational interfaces. In a second step we zoom into two marginal settlements to determine whether ecosystem-based measures for landslide risk reduction already exist and assess the potential to either implement or further increase their application. These so-called favelas are often constructed on or beneath steep and degraded slopes prone to landslides. Landslides are mainly triggered by heavy rainfall events which are likely to increase in the future due to the impacts of global climate change. Activities to reduce landslide risk are distributed between many different actors, such as civil defense, geological survey, urban planning, and environmental management, and the measures taken are predominantly engineered approaches with a focus on preparedness and response. The urban reforestation program which could provide additional ecosystem benefits is not yet aligned enough with risk reduction and faces several challenges. In addition, the consideration of informal settings in formal urban planning and management strategies can still be improved. Based on quantitative and qualitative data from interviews and secondary sources, site visits, and expert interviews with representatives from public authorities and other stakeholders, the research assesses the individual institutional approaches as well as the overall urban governance system with regard to disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. The potential governance challenges for fostering ecosystem-based approaches are analyzed and clustered to provide an insight on paths that could facilitate the future consideration of Eco-DRR/EbA in Rio de Janeiro and beyond.","[Sandholz, Simone] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, UN Campus,Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Lange, Wolfram] Humboldt Univ, Ctr Rural Dev SLE, Hessische Str 1-2, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Nehren, Udo] TH Koln Univ Appl Sci, Inst Technol & Resources Management Trop & Subtro, Betzdorfer Str 2, D-50679 Cologne, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Sandholz, S (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, UN Campus,Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",sandholz@ehs.unu.edu; w.lange@gmx.net; udo.nehren@th-koeln.de,"Lange, Wolfram/AAX-2258-2021; Nehren, Udo/AAJ-2155-2021","Nehren, Udo/0000-0001-6236-3542",Lincoln Institute of Land Policy,Lincoln Institute of Land Policy,The research presented here was carried out with financial support of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy.,,83,14,15,3,47,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

However, most reported studies are vague on the choice of the global circulation models (GCMs) for climate projections, and on the corresponding uncertainty with this type of model simulations. Here we investigated whether climate-crop modelling can be used for identifying crop management-level adaptation options. We focused our analyses on a case study for maize in southern Africa using the APSIM crop growth model and projections from 17 individual climate models for the period 2017-2060 for the contrasting representative concentration pathways 2.6 and 8.5. Intensification of nitrogen fertiliser use (from 30 to 90 kg N ha(-1)) was simulated as an example of a crop management-level adaptation to climate change. Uncertainties in crop yield predictions were about 30 to 60%, i.e. larger than expected crop responses to most management-level interventions or adaptations. Variation in simulated yields was caused by inter-seasonal rainfall variability and uncertainty with climate models. Some GCMs resulted in significantly different maize yield predictions, without any clear pattern across sites. Given these high uncertainties, we argue that crop modellers should be cautious when informing future crop management adaptation strategies based on climate-crop model ensembles. A better use of crop models is the simulation of crop responses to current weather variability aiming at the identification of crop management practices for coping with climate variability. Promising practices can then be evaluated with farmers on their feasibility over a range of plausible future biophysical and socio-economic farming conditions.","[Corbeels, Marc; Rusinamhodzi, Leonard] CIMMYT, Sustainable Intensificat Program, POB 1041-00621, Nairobi, Kenya; [Corbeels, Marc; Berre, David] Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, UPR Agroecol & Sustainable Intensificat Annual Cr, Ave Agropolis, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Lopez-Ridaura, Santiago] CIMMYT, Sustainable Intensificat Program, POB 6-641, Mexico City 06600, DF, Mexico",CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Corbeels, M (corresponding author), CIMMYT, Sustainable Intensificat Program, POB 1041-00621, Nairobi, Kenya.",m.corbeels@cgiar.org,"Rusinamhodzi, Leonard/N-1687-2014; DAVID, BERRE/AAJ-3354-2020; Rusinamhodzi, Leonard/ABH-8601-2020","Rusinamhodzi, Leonard/0000-0002-5576-2040; Rusinamhodzi, Leonard/0000-0002-5576-2040; Berre, david/0000-0001-8494-9966","French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD) through the Agropolis Foundation; CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), as part of the Agriculture Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP); CGIAR Research Program on Maize (CRP MAIZE), as part of the Agriculture Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP)","French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD) through the Agropolis Foundation; CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), as part of the Agriculture Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP); CGIAR Research Program on Maize (CRP MAIZE), as part of the Agriculture Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP)","The study was financially supported by the twin postdoc program between the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD) through the Agropolis Foundation, and the CGIAR Research Programs on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), and on Maize (CRP MAIZE), as part of the Agriculture Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP).

CSA innovations, improved variety, compost, row planting, and agroforestry, provide farmers with the benefits of enhanced food security and climate change adaptation, reducing GHG emissions from farm plots. Crop rotation provides farmers with enhanced food security and reduced livelihood vulnerability, while SWC meets the goal of enhancing food security and reducing GHG emissions. Unfortunately, adopting crop residue management, one of the recommended CSA practices in Ethiopia, does not deliver at least two of the CSA pillars. Farmers should be encouraged to adopt improved variety, crop rotation, compost, row planting, soil and water conservation, and agroforestry as the best portfolio of CSA innovation for highland smallholder agriculture systems.","[Teklu, Abyiot; Simane, Belay] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Addis Ababa 1176, Ethiopia; [Bezabih, Mintewab] Ethiopian Policy Studies Inst, Addis Ababa 2479, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Teklu, A (corresponding author), Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Addis Ababa 1176, Ethiopia.",abyiot.teklu@aau.edu.et,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Simane, Belay/0000-0002-8004-3486",Addis Ababa University (AAU),Addis Ababa University (AAU),The authors would like to thank Addis Ababa University (AAU) for providing financial support for the data collection and write-up of the manuscript.,,107,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2022,14,23,,,,,,,16143,10.3390/su142316143,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142316143,,,26,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6Y7KF,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000897268900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, few studies have examined how mitigation and adaptation efforts relate to each other in a large number of differently sized cities, and therefore we know little about whether forerunners in mitigation are also leading in adaptation or if cities tend to focus on just one policy field. This article develops an internationally applicable approach to rank cities on climate policy that incorporates multiple indicators related to (1) local commitments on mitigation and adaptation, (2) urban mitigation and adaptation plans and (3) climate adaptation and mitigation ambitions. We apply this method to rank 104 differently sized German cities and identify six clusters: climate policy leaders, climate adaptation leaders, climate mitigation leaders, climate policy followers, climate policy latecomers and climate policy laggards. The article seeks explanations for particular cities' positions and shows that coping with climate change in a balanced way on a high level depends on structural factors, in particular city size, the pathways of local climate policies since the 1990s and funding programmes for both climate mitigation and adaptation.","[Otto, Antje; Thieken, Annegret H.] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Kern, Kristine; Haupt, Wolfgang; Eckersley, Peter] Leibniz Inst Res Soc & Space eV IRS, Flakenstr 29-31, D-15537 Berlin, Germany; [Kern, Kristine] Abo Akad Univ, Fac Social Sci Business & Econ, Vanrikinkatu 3 B, Turku 20500, Finland; [Eckersley, Peter] Nottingham Trent Univ, Newton Bldg,Goldsmith St, Nottingham NG1 4BU, England",University of Potsdam; Abo Akademi University; Nottingham Trent University,"Otto, A (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.",anotto@uni-potsdam.de,"Thieken, Annegret Henriette/B-1946-2017","Thieken, Annegret Henriette/0000-0001-7068-2615; Haupt, Wolfgang/0000-0002-1042-2106; Eckersley, Peter/0000-0001-9048-8529; Kern, Kristine/0000-0001-9923-4621","Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [FKZ 01LR1709A1, FKZ 01LR1709B1]",Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

We analyse national adaptation documents from the 27 European Union member states and interview city-level experts (n = 17) on the integration of three categories of adaptation efforts: general efforts to minimize health impacts related to climate change, targeted efforts to enhance resilience in health systems, and supportive efforts to foster the potential of the first two categories. At a national level, general efforts to address vector-borne diseases and heat-related illness are covered comprehensively, whereas efforts addressing several climate-related health risks are neglected (e.g. water-borne diseases, injuries from extreme weather and cardiopulmonary health) or overlooked (e.g. malnutrition and mental health). Targeted efforts to inform policy decisions, such as carrying out research, risk monitoring and assessments, are often described in detail, but efforts to manage day-to-day health care delivery and emergency situations receive little attention. At the urban level, health issues receive less attention in climate adaptation policy and planning. If health topics are included, they are often described as indirect benefits of adaptation efforts in other sectors and not perceived as the priority of the involved authorities. This effectively means that general and targeted efforts are the responsibility of other sectoral departments, while supportive efforts are the responsibility of the national government or external organizations. As a result, at an urban level, climate-related health system adaptation is not a policy aim in its own right, and many potentially high health risks are being ignored. In order for health risks to be better integrated into adaptation policy and planning, it is critical to interconnect national and urban levels, reduce sectoral thinking and welcome external expertize and facilitate large-scale data collection and sharing of health and climate indicators.Key policy insightsWe recommend focussing on cooperatively drafting strategies for integrating health issues into climate policy and planning with stakeholders at the national and urban levels, in different policy sectors and in society.Policy planners can build on the strengths of adaptation documents from other countries or cities and take note of any weaknesses.We advocate to foster co-benefits for health and climate action of various adaptation measures (e.g. by promoting active mobility and urban greenery, health impacts related to heat, (mental and physical) stress and air pollution are reduced).Large-scale data collection and sharing of health and climate indicators should be facilitated to support learning and pro-active decision-making.","[Hoeben, Annechien Dirkje] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Syst Sci Innovat & Sustainabil Res, Graz, Austria; [Otto, Ilona M.] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Graz, Austria; [Chersich, Matthew F.] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Reprod Hlth & HIV Inst, Fac Hlth Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Hoeben, Annechien Dirkje] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Syst Sci Innovat & Sustainabil Res, Merangasse 18-1, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz; University of Graz; University of Witwatersrand; University of Graz,"Hoeben, AD (corresponding author), Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Syst Sci Innovat & Sustainabil Res, Merangasse 18-1, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",annechien.hoeben@uni-graz.at,,,ENBEL Project - European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [101003966]; CASCADES Project - European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [821010],ENBEL Project - European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; CASCADES Project - European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme,"The research was supported by the ENBEL Project, funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement number 101003966, as well as the CASCADES Project, funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 821010.",,34,0,0,5,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

However, it began to flourish about a decade later through a subsequent development of institutions, policies and supporting financial mechanisms. Various adaptation approaches and development practices have been evolving over the last couple of decades through a process of scrutiny, debates, and critiques. One such recent approach is called conflict-sensitive adaptation, which encompasses concepts to understand potential conflict-inflicting elements and peacebuilding aspects of adaptation interventions. This paper examines 35 peer-reviewed research articles that have analysed field data with the notion of conceptualising conflict-sensitive CCA initiatives. Emerging key results were presented and discussed in different academic forums to stimulate peer reflections and debates. We found that the understanding of conflict-sensitive adaptation has its universality in engaging with diverse stakeholders. However, practicalities were different in the cases of the global north and the global south. In the global south, there is a concentration of research in areas of pre-existing conflict in Africa and Asia, where climate change links are often assumed from IPCC reports in order to compensate for the unavailability of field data. However, from the perspective of adaptation politics and governance, there is a concerted urge for the emancipatory participation of local and marginalised populations. We argue for a need to pretest adaptation projects through a conflict lens. Decolonising the adaptation and understanding of local geography is critical in such planning.","[Nadiruzzaman, Md; Scheffran, Juergen] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Res Grp Climate Change & Secur CLISEC, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CEN, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Shewly, Hosna J.] Fulda Univ Appl Sci, Dept Social & Cultural Sci, D-36037 Fulda, Germany; [Kley, Stefanie] Univ Hamburg, Fac Econ & Social Sci, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg; University of Hamburg,"Nadiruzzaman, M (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Res Grp Climate Change & Secur CLISEC, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CEN, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",md.nadiruzzaman@uni-hamburg.de; juergen.scheffran@uni-hamburg.de; hosna.shewly@sk.hs-fulda.de; stefanie.kley@uni-hamburg.de,"Scheffran, Jürgen/M-6876-2019; Nadiruzzaman/AAF-4528-2019","Scheffran, Jürgen/0000-0002-7171-3062; Nadiruzzaman/0000-0002-4829-5114; Kley, Stefanie/0000-0003-3400-7799","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [390683824]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This research was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany`s Excellence Strategy-EXC 2037 `CLICCS-Climate, Climatic Change, and Society' (Project Number: 390683824) and a contribution to the Center for Earth System Research and Sustainability (CEN) of Universitat Hamburg.",,65,1,1,10,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2022,14,13,,,,,,,8060,10.3390/su14138060,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14138060,,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,2V5YW,,gold,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000823922300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study finds that Nepal's National Adaptation Programme of Action, NAPA, and Local Adaptation Plans, LAPA, consistently address outcome vulnerability at the expense of contextual vulnerability, and that they offer little new in terms of challenging the sructural root causes of vulnerability compared with development as usual approaches. Because these CCA policies build on an apolitical analysis of vulnerability, they not only promote one-dimensional technocratic solutions that ignore the drivers of local vulnerability, they also run the risk of reinforcing existing vulnerability patterns and even reducing the adaptive capacity of the most vulnerable. This article argues that - in order to effectively respond to the impacts of climate change on local vulnerability - adaptation policies need to integrate a contextual vulnerability analysis and promote responses that contribute to change the conditions that create vulnerability in the first place.

Due to climate change induced sea-level rise, these defences will become exposed to higher storm surges and adaptation becomes inevitable. As an alternative to strengthening, managed retreat is discussed in literature as a coastal risk management option for climate change adaptation. Based on an evaluation of examples from the Wadden Sea, this paper elaborates managed retreat as alternative climate change adaptation from a coastal risk management perspective. This paper concludes that, conform the principles of integrated coastal zone management, one precondition for successful implementation of managed retreat is local acceptance. With respect to natural resilience to sea-level rise, managed retreat may counteract the loss of Wadden Sea structures and habitats due to coastal squeeze. However, the effectiveness depends on the surface elevation in the opened polder. If large volumes of sediment are needed to restore a natural elevation, regional resilience against SLR-induced drowning may deteriorate. With respect to coastal flood risk management in Schleswig-Holstein, opened polders have no significance as flood retention rooms and managed retreat does not reduce the hazard of flooding in surrounding polders. Further, removal of primary embankments requires large efforts to secure flood safety in adjacent polders. Under certain conditions, removal or opening of embankments may constitute sustainable coastal risk management, e.g., if retreat leads to a shorter line of defence or if other win-win-situations like securing of NATURA 2000 coherence arise.","[Hofstede, Jacobus L.

Given the increases in extreme weather events projected to affect the Southern Africa region, it is essential to assess how household and community-level adaptations have been helped or hindered by institutional structures and national policy instruments. In particular, there is a need to reflect on efforts related to the United Nations' environmental conventions to ensure that policies support the maintenance of local adaptations and help retain the resilience of socio-economic and environmental systems. This paper examines three interlinked drivers of adaptation: climate change, desertification and drought, assessing the extent to which international and national policy supports local adaptive strategies in three countries in southern Africa. We show that while common ground exists between desertification and climate change adaptations at the policy level, they are insufficiently mainstreamed within broader development approaches. Similarly, there are some overlaps between policy-driven and autonomous local adaptations, but the mutually supportive links between them are poorly developed.

Accelerated sea level rise, increasing temperatures and changing wind climate may strongly alter present structures and functions of the ecosystem with negative consequences both for nature conservation and for coastal risk management. Being aware of these challenges, Schleswig-Holstein State Government decided to establish an integrated climate change adaptation strategy for the Schleswig-Holstein sector of the Wadden Sea. The strategy was adopted in June 2015. It aims at the long-term maintenance of present functions and structures as well as the integrity of the Wadden Sea ecosystem in a changing climate. The strategy was prepared by a project group consisting of representatives from State authorities as well as from nature conservation organisations and local institutions. First outcome of the strategy is that extra adaptation measures will not be necessary in the coming decades. However, pending on the future rate of sea level rise, shoreline erosion and sediment deficits in the Wadden Sea will increase and sooner or later drowning of tidal flats and terrestrial habitats like beaches, primary dunes and salt marshes will start. At the time when management measures to counteract the negative developments become expedient from a nature conservation viewpoint as well as for coastal risk management, adequate actions with minimized ecological interferences are possible. It is assumed that balancing the sediment deficits as the main adaptation measure may be implemented most efficiently by concentrating sediment suppletion at locations where natural forces organize redistribution in the Wadden Sea. Local technical coastal risk management measures like the strengthening of sea defences will, nevertheless, remain necessary as well.","[Hofstede, Jacobus L.

This study examines the perceptions and adaptations to climate change of farmers in Quzhou County in the NCP. Structured interviews were held with 37 smallholder farmers to determine their perceptions of and adaptations to climate change in the past 30 yr. Historical meteorological data ( 1980 to 2010) showed a significant increase in mean annual temperature of 1.7 degrees C over 30 yr and no significant change in mean annual rainfall, but farmers perceive increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall during this period. We hypothesize that this leads farmers to irrigate more, due to their perception that the changing temperature and precipitation regime is increasing crop water stress. Further increase in annual temperature predicted for the NCP will intensify irrigation and deplete the groundwater reserves used for irrigation in this area. Farmers in the NCP require decision-making tools to develop sustainable irrigation practices for long-term adaptation to climate change.","[Chen, David] McGill Univ, Fac Agr & Environm Sci, Macdonald Campus,21111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Whalen, Joann K.] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Macdonald Campus,21111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada",McGill University; McGill University,"Whalen, JK (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Macdonald Campus,21111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.",joann.whalen@mcgill.ca,"Whalen, Joann K/F-7419-2013","Whalen, Joann K/0000-0001-8774-0594; Chen, David Meng-Chuen/0000-0001-5939-9093","National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada [46582, 2383823-10]",National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"Funding for the study was provided by the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada's Undergraduate Student Research Award 46582 and Discovery Program (grant # 2383823-10).

The first part of this paper reviews current knowledge on mainstreaming climate change adaptation into development. It then assesses how far climate change has been mainstreamed into key development plans and programmes in the Philippines. Interviews with key informants were also conducted. The results show that there is no mainstreaming in the Philippines. All the major development plans and policies reviewed did not contain any reference to climate change adaptation. Interviews with key stakeholders reveal a similar trend. The main reason preventing mainstreaming are that national priorities are biased towards concerns deemed more pressing, and that there is a pervasive lack of awareness about the impacts of climate change on sustainable development. However, there are massive investments in infrastructure projects designed to adapt to weather-related hazards. Projects such as these could provide an entry point for integrating climate change adaptation into development plans and policy in the Philippines.","[Lasco, Rodel D.; Pulhin, Florencia B.; Jaranilla-Sanchez, Patricia Ann; Delfino, Rafaela Jane P.] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, College Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines; [Pulhin, Florencia B.] UPLB, Forestry Dev Ctr, CFNR, College Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines; [Pulhin, Florencia B.; Garcia, Kristine] UPLB, Environm Forestry Programme, CFNR, College Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines; [Gerpacio, Roberta] UPLB, SE Asian Reg Ctr Grad Study & Res Agr, College Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines",CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF); University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos,"Lasco, RD (corresponding author), World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Khush Hall,IRRI Campus, College Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines.",r.lasco@cgiar.org,"Rodel, Lasco/AAA-6206-2022","Rodel, Lasco/0000-0003-3675-4237",,,,,37,31,31,1,37,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

With a wave of support, the City of Prince George, Canada, pursued adaptation initiatives for six years; however, part way through the project, political changes resulted in a local governmental shift in focus. Semi-structured interviews with local experts reflect on how political changes affected the nature and legacy of adaptation in Prince George. Respondents indicated that the new political regime was not anti-environmental but explicitly focused on reducing costs, which meant minimizing studies and providing essential services. Initiatives related to transportation infrastructure and land use planning continued to move forward, whereas issues related to flooding and ecosystems were stalled. Plans and strategies that make clear links to costs and actions, and where the public clearly understands how inactions will affect them, are more likely to move forward in a less supportive political environment. Redundancies in capacity are important to maintain institutional memory. Effective communication is essential for stakeholders to understand why local governments should invest in adaptation, and to potentially present adaptation as a positive unifying direction for a community.","[Picketts, Ian M.] Quest Univ Canada, 3200 Univ Blvd, Squamish, BC V8B 0N8, Canada",,"Picketts, IM (corresponding author), Quest Univ Canada, 3200 Univ Blvd, Squamish, BC V8B 0N8, Canada.",ian.picketts@questu.ca,,,Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions fellowship; Natural Resources Canada; City of Prince George,Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions fellowship; Natural Resources Canada(Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service); City of Prince George,"Thank you to all of those interviewed: you are true experts, and your commitment and knowledge is inspiring.

Current approaches to geographic information dissemination to smallholders, such as the rural extension model, are limited, yet advancements in internet and communication technologies (ICTs) could help augment these processes through the provision of agricultural geographic information (AGI) directly to farmers. We analysed recent ICT initiatives for communicating climate and agriculture-related information to smallholders for improved livelihoods and climate change adaptation. Through the critical analysis of initiatives, we identified opportunities for the success of future AGI developments. We systematically examined 27 AGI initiatives reported in academic and grey literature (e.g., organisational databases). Important factors identified for the success of initiatives include affordability, language(s), community partnerships, user collaboration, high quality and locally-relevant information through low-tech platforms, organisational trust, clear business models, and adaptability. We propose initiatives should be better-targeted to deliver AGI to regions in most need of climate adaptation assistance, including SE Asia, the Pacific, and the Caribbean. Further assessment of the most effective technological approaches is needed. Initiatives should be independently assessed for evaluation of their uptake and success, and local communities should be better-incorporated into the development of AGI initiatives.","[Haworth, Billy Tusker] Univ Manchester, Humanitarian & Conflict Response Inst, Ellen Wilkinson Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Biggs, Eloise; Duncan, John; Boruff, Bryan] Univ Western Australia, UWA Sch Agr & Environm, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Wales, Nathan] Univ South Pacific, Sch Geog Earth Sci & Environm, Suva, Fiji; [Bruce, Eleanor] Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Manchester; University of Western Australia; University of the South Pacific; University of Sydney,"Haworth, BT (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Humanitarian & Conflict Response Inst, Ellen Wilkinson Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",billy.haworth@manchester.ac.uk; eloise.biggs@uwa.edu.au; john.duncan@uwa.edu.au; wales_n@usp.ac.fj; bryan.boruff@uwa.edu.au; eleanor.bruce@sydney.edu.au,"Haworth, Billy Tusker/AAB-1258-2020; Bruce, Eleanor/AAP-4305-2020","Haworth, Billy Tusker/0000-0002-4191-9502; Wales, Nathan/0000-0002-8288-4916; Duncan, John/0000-0001-9752-1002; Boruff, Bryan/0000-0001-6693-0671; Biggs, Eloise/0000-0002-8380-0489",Australian Centre for International Agriculture Research (ACIAR) [ASEM-2016-30]; University of Sydney; University of the South Pacific,Australian Centre for International Agriculture Research (ACIAR)(Australian Ctr Intl Agr Res); University of Sydney(University of Sydney); University of the South Pacific,"This research was funded under project ASEM-2016-30, an Australian Centre for International Agriculture Research (ACIAR) small research activity led by the University of Western Australia in collaboration with the University of Sydney and the University of the South Pacific.",,102,12,12,2,21,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2225-1154,,,CLIMATE,Climate,DEC,2018,6,4,,,,,,,97,10.3390/cli6040097,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli6040097,,,20,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,HG7UD,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000455199900020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Four frames were identified: inadequate infrastructure; information deficits; limited planning capacity; and insecure access. In all frames, there was internal coherence among: the problems identified; the form solutions are expected to take; and who should be included and in what roles. All projects claimed to be addressing the needs of farmers vulnerable to climate change. The infrastructure, information, and capacity frames are apolitical and privilege expert knowledge, whereas the access frame places rights and justice issues centrally, and thus holds more potential for addressing the root causes of vulnerabilities and supporting more just distribution of resources and power. Framing can interact with how projects are governed, for example, through assigning roles to actors based on types of solutions prescribed. The extent and direction of frame elaboration also depend on how a project is governed. Meeting local needs and objectives, for example, is constrained when external actors have too much influence in project governing structures, and initial project plans written from afar are followed too narrowly. This study shows that frames are an important part of the governance of adaptation projects.","[Lebel, Louis; Lebel, Phimphakan] Chiang Mai Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Unit Social & Environm Res, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Lebel, Louis; Lebel, Phimphakan] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Kakonen, Mira] Univ Turku, Turku, Finland; [Dany, Va; Thuon, Try] Royal Univ Phnom Penh, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Voladet, Saykham] Natl Econ Res Inst, Vang Vieng, Laos",Chiang Mai University; University of Melbourne; University of Turku,"Lebel, L (corresponding author), Chiang Mai Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Unit Social & Environm Res, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.;Lebel, L (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",llebel@loxinfo.co.th,"Käkönen, Mira/EWC-6958-2022; Lebel, Louis/D-4130-2014","Käkönen, Mira/0000-0002-2350-4020; Lebel, Louis/0000-0001-6187-6418",,,,,57,16,16,1,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Binary logit models were applied on data of 386 farmers, collected from three different agro-ecological zones of Punjab, Pakistan, to present a comprehensive analysis of different adaptation strategies missing in the existing literature. The coefficients of a binary logit model only explain the direction of change; therefore, to see the magnitude of change, marginal effects were also estimated. Findings revealed that farmers perceived climate change and opted different adaptation strategies. Results of binary logit models described age, education, farming experience, landholding, access to climate information, access to credit facilities, and access to extension services as important determinants of adaptation. This research also found lack of access to climate information, lack of irrigation resources, and knowledge about appropriate adaptations as key constraints in adaptation process. This situation can be improved by enhancing institutional support and capacity. It is suggested that improved agricultural education with better access to climate information and extension services affects the farmers' well-being directly and hence is good for the economy of Pakistan.","[Ali, Muhammad Faisal] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Agr & Resource Econ, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Rose, Sobia] Govt Punjab, Punjab Econ Res Inst, Planning & Dev Dept, Lahore, Pakistan",University of Agriculture Faisalabad,"Ali, MF (corresponding author), Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Agr & Resource Econ, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",faisalaliuaf@gmail.com,,,,,,,46,5,5,3,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is the core of the mitigation strategies that are effective countermeasures to address a changing climate in the long term. Nevertheless, the need for short-term solutions regarding adaptation to climate change (ACC) has gained growing interest in the scientific community and in European institutions. European and national ACC principles are being integrated in strategies and plans. In Italy, some regions have adopted ACC principles in strategic plans, which influence the whole local planning system and persuade local communities to become more climate-resilient. This study focuses on the mainstreaming of ACC into strategies, plans, programs, and projects (SPPPs) adopted by the following Italian cities: Bologna, Milan, Naples, Rome, Turin, and Venice. We scrutinize the contents of SPPPs with respect to four criteria: (i) references to strategies or plans for ACC; (ii) inclusion of ACC objectives and (iii) measures; and (iv) references to-or the inclusion of-climatic analysis on historical series and/or future projections. We found out that most SPPPs adopted by the cities have considered ACC in a promising way, i.e., all the cities are inclined to promote ACC, despite three of them lacking a municipal ACC strategy or plan and a National Adaptation Plan not being in force.","[Serra, Vittorio; Ledda, Antonio; Ruiu, Maria Grazia Gavina; Calia, Giovanna; Marras, Serena; Spano, Donatella; De Montis, Andrea] Univ Sassari, Dept Agr Sci, Viale Italia 39-A, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Calia, Giovanna; De Montis, Andrea] Univ Cagliari, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Architecture, Via Marengo 2, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy; [Mereu, Valentina; Bacciu, Valentina; Marras, Serena; Spano, Donatella] Euro Mediterranean Ctr Climate Change CMCC Fdn, Via Nicola 9, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Bacciu, Valentina] CNR, Inst BioEcon, Traversa La Crucca 3, I-07100 Sassari, Italy",University of Sassari; University of Cagliari; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per la BioEconomia (IBE-CNR),"Ledda, A (corresponding author), Univ Sassari, Dept Agr Sci, Viale Italia 39-A, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",vittorio.serra1986@gmail.com; antonioledda@uniss.it; mgruiu.mgr@gmail.com; giovannacalia@live.it; valentina.mereu@cmcc.it; valentina.bacciu@ibe.cnr.it; serenam@uniss.it; spano@uniss.it; andreadm@uniss.it,"Ledda, Antonio/J-7822-2015; Marras, Serena/AAJ-1635-2021; Ruiu, Maria Grazia Gavina/GOH-1497-2022; De Montis, Andrea/J-6244-2013; Mereu, Valentina/K-1398-2018","Ledda, Antonio/0000-0003-2351-5544; Ruiu, Maria Grazia Gavina/0000-0003-4282-0552; De Montis, Andrea/0000-0002-3849-2595; Mereu, Valentina/0000-0002-6402-7179; Calia, Giovanna/0000-0003-0624-8528; Spano, Donatella/0000-0002-5661-0241; serra, vittorio/0000-0003-2175-1295",European Climate Foundation (ECF),European Climate Foundation (ECF),"Y This work is funded by the European Climate Foundation (ECF) through the project << Analisi del rischio.

This research analyzed interviews with Australian and Canadian professionals who worked with climate change knowledge in research, policy, and practice to gauge in what way their climate knowledge was linked to autonomous adaptation in personal circles. Analysis combined a thematic approach and a novel Future Climate Narrative (FCN) typology informed by literature relating to Future Thinking, Climate Knowledge and Narrative Communication. The results identified four main narratives: Distance, Vulnerability, Agency, and Change. Findings showed that where Change narratives were not commonly shared, little climate change knowledge was exchanged in personal circles, especially information that might increase a sense of danger; challenge the imagination; or present unfamiliar scenarios. This research shows that without future-oriented narratives supporting autonomous and community adaptation planning and practice, the benefits of currently high social adaptive capacity and relatively low vulnerability to climate change may not be realized through proactive adaptation. In developed nations where near- term, and in some cases unavoidable, climate change impacts are not commonly discussed, new Change narratives linking Climate Knowledge and Future Thinking are needed to reflect swiftly evolving climate change scenarios. In addition, lack of adaptation planning among well-informed professionals again challenges expectations that more and better climate change knowledge will directly increase adaptation behaviour, irrespective of engagement in future thinking.","[Coulter, Liese; Serrao-Neumann, Silvia; Coiacetto, Eddo] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, 170 Kessels Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Serrao-Neumann, Silvia] Univ Waikato, Sch Social Sci, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand",Griffith University; University of Waikato,"Coulter, L (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, 170 Kessels Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",liese.coulter@gmail.com,"Coulter, Liese/AAL-5017-2020","Coulter, Liese/0000-0002-8072-2534; Serrao-Neumann, Silvia/0000-0001-9601-4914",Griffith University; Simon Fraser University; CSIRO; Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions,Griffith University(Griffith University); Simon Fraser University; CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions,"This research was completed with support from Griffith University and Simon Fraser University Collaborative Travel Grants Scheme round 2014, CSIRO and the Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions.",,58,13,13,2,31,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,AUG,2019,111,,,,,,57,70,,10.1016/j.futures.2019.05.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2019.05.004,,,14,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,IN5GL,,Green Published,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000478703800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Alongside this growth, adaptation has been folded into the world of development. This article reviews the ways that adaptation has become a concern for the world of development, suggesting three important trends: problematizations of vulnerability, the financial architecture of adaptation, and the tool of climate change mainstreaming'. Given that adaptation has entered the development arena, this article reviews relevant critical development literature that might helpfully shed light on the operation of adaptation. The article first reviews a tripartite typology of development scholarship: pro-development/instrumental, post-development, and critical development studies. Then, it reviews the analogous research on adaptation according to this typology, showing the limits to both the instrumental and post-adaptation scholarship. Finally, the article engages a vein of critical development studies - concerned particularly with the churning of development priorities and their management and governance - in order examine how adaptation works as an organizing principle.","[Webber, Sophie] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, 1255 Bunche Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Webber, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, 1255 Bunche Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",srwebber@ucla.edu,,"Webber, Sophie/0000-0002-7597-4622",Social Science and Humanities Research Council Canada Graduate Scholarship; Postdoctoral Research Fellowship; Killam Fellowship; University of British Columbia,Social Science and Humanities Research Council Canada Graduate Scholarship; Postdoctoral Research Fellowship; Killam Fellowship; University of British Columbia,"I acknowledge the receipt of a Social Science and Humanities Research Council Canada Graduate Scholarship, and Postdoctoral Research Fellowship, a Killam Fellowship, and University of British Columbia internal grants, all of which supported this research project.

Beyond standard scientometrics, questions about if and how the field is progressing thus remain largely unanswered. Here we provide a novel, inquisitive, computer-assisted evidence mapping methodology that combines expert interviews (n = 26) and structural topic modelling to evaluate open-ended research questions on progress in the field. We apply this to 62 191 adaptation-relevant scientific publications (1988-2020), selected through supervised machine learning from a comprehensive climate change query. Comparing the literature to key benchmarks of mature adaptation research, our findings align with trends in the adaptation literature observed by most experts: the field is maturing, growing rapidly, and diversifying, with social science and implementation topics arising next to the still-dominant natural sciences and impacts-focused research. Formally assessing the representativeness of IPCC citations, we find evidence of a delay effect for fast-growing areas of research like adaptation strategies and governance. Similarly, we show significant topic biases by geographic location: especially disaster and development-related topics are often studied in Southern countries by authors from the North, while Northern countries dominate governance topics. Moreover, there is a general paucity of research in some highly vulnerable countries. Experts lastly signal a need for meaningful stakeholder involvement. Expanding on the methods presented here would aid the comprehensive and transparent monitoring of adaptation research. For the evidence synthesis community, our methodology provides an example of how to move beyond the descriptive towards the inquisitive and formally evaluating research questions.","[Sietsma, Anne J.; Ford, James D.; Callaghan, Max W.; Minx, Jan C.] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Callaghan, Max W.; Minx, Jan C.] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany",University of Leeds,"Sietsma, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",eeajs@leeds.ac.uk,"Callaghan, Max W/I-1769-2019; Ford, James/A-4284-2013","Callaghan, Max W/0000-0001-8292-8758; Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456; Sietsma, Anne Jelmar/0000-0003-0239-152X; Minx, Jan Christoph/0000-0002-2862-0178","UK Natural Environment Research Council (Panorama DTP); German Ministry for Education and Research [01LG1910A, 03SFK5J0]",UK Natural Environment Research Council (Panorama DTP); German Ministry for Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"We wish to thank the experts interviewed for this work, all of whom were extremely generous with their time.

To establish an initial empirical understanding of the terms of the debate, we conducted a Q method study of the views of scientists and resource managers, a key constituency because of their role in decision-making and implementation. We asked 24 forest managers in Ontario, Canada and 26 top-publishing ecologists and conservation biologists to evaluate their level of agreement with 33 statements about assisted colonization from the published literature and other relevant sources. The analysis revealed four main, contrasting perspectives, which we label Ecological Interventionist, Nativist Technocrat, Interventionist Technocrat, and Reluctant Interventionist; all but the Nativist Technocrats were open to assisted colonization. Disagreements between the four perspectives were defined by value-based and policy-strategic considerations at least as much as they were by varied understandings of technical issues. Assisted colonization as a climate adaptation strategy exists within the context of multiple competing and incompatible problem definitions even amongst these technical stakeholders. Based upon our findings and the relevant literature, we conclude that disputes surrounding assisted colonization will likely not be settled by additional scientific research. Rather, underlying non-technical considerations need to be brought to the fore and addressed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Neff, Mark W.; Larson, Brendon M.

Research from developing countries and cognate resource sectors suggests that these considerations are critical for enhancing local adaptive capacity. Despite extensive review of forestry research across North America and western Europe, we found almost no research that addresses how differential social capabilities within forest-based communities affect adaptation to climate change. In this paper, we document the potential that gender sensitivity might provide to conceptions and practical applications of adaptive capacity and identify four types of research opportunities to address this gap: (i) developing disaggregated capitals frameworks; (ii) creating inclusive models; (iii) informing social planning; and (iv) understanding gender main-streaming.

The literature suggests that especially policy factors - government interventions, political priorities and public-private cooperation - and market factors - cost offset, cost mitigation, planning flexibility and business opportunities - shape private actor approaches. To increase the understanding of insurance company involvement in adaptation, this study examines how insurance companies' approaches are influenced by policy and market factors in three countries: Denmark, Norway and Sweden. The study found that the policy factors tested significantly shaped the approaches of the companies assessed, while market factors currently appear less influential. This is likely due to the absence of climate risk and adaptation in political debates and among insurance policyholders.

This priority does not accord with the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is to achieve stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions. This paper reports upon studies in Uganda designed to help in the development of a national adaptation strategy, and addresses the need to reconcile such a strategy with the global priority accorded to mitigation and with national economic development priorities.

In response, humans must adapt to altered climatic and environmental conditions. While climate change adaptation is a pressing issue in many sectors and regions, the adaptation of environmental management strategies is particularly urgent because of the severity and extent of risks associated with projected impacts. Robust adaptation of environmental management requires effective spatial and temporal implementation of interventions, with explicit consideration of trade-offs between different socio-economic and environmental objectives. We investigate the critical interface between regional governance systems and spatial planning for climate adaptation by exploring the case of Australia's Natural Resource Management (NRM) bodies. Australia's NRM bodies provide an ideal case study for two reasons. First, Australia faces significant threats from current and future climate changes. Second, Australian NRM bodies have recently undertaken a major program of spatial planning and research to explicitly address the need for climate adaptation. We explore the interface between regional governance systems and spatial planning by: 1) reviewing the historical development of institutional arrangements in relation to spatial planning by Australia's regional NRM bodies; 2) documenting current planning processes with regard to climate adaptation and more generally; and 3) identifying strengths and weaknesses of the existing governance system at various scales with respect to its ability to foster effective spatial planning. We find that the institutional and resource capacity of the Australian regional NRM bodies is currently being eroded and that the national governance system is broadly failing to deliver on the intended outcomes of climate-ready NRM plans. We make recommendations for governance reform and institutional adaptation to improve spatial planning for climate adaptation in Australia and discuss the broader implications of our findings.","[Adams, V.

Many constraints might hinder the implementation of adaptation pilot projects due to lack of economic, knowledge, and technical available re-sources. Local institutions find difficulties in building a coherent local adaptation planning and design processes with international and national frameworks. In this context, this article proposes a methodology based on the available international frameworks to support the small communities with the aim to implement adaptation pilot projects within different sectors. In doing so, this paper tests a climate change adaptation cycle for pilot projects development in small municipalities; the first in Italy for small municipalities under 20.000 inhabitants. The proposed methodology could lead local adaptation initiatives in climate change risk assessment by supporting the research communities in developing a coherent vision for the local territories and to identify proper oriented measures to enhance demonstrative pilot projects and to increase the level of resilience in small municipalities, avoiding maladaptation.","[Ricciardi, Guglielmo; Ellena, Marta; Barbato, Giuliana; Giugliano, Giuseppe; Schiano, Pasquale; Mercogliano, Paola] Fdn Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Reg Models & Geohydrol Impact Div, I-81100 Caserta, Italy; [Ricciardi, Guglielmo] Politecn Torino, Dept Architecture & Design, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Leporati, Sara; Traina, Claudia] Fdn Compagnia SanPaolo, I-10128 Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin,"Ricciardi, G (corresponding author), Fdn Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Reg Models & Geohydrol Impact Div, I-81100 Caserta, Italy.",guglielmo.ricciardi@cmcc.it; marta.ellena@cmcc.it; giuliana.barbato@cmcc.it; giuseppe.giugliano@cmcc.it; pasquale.schiano@cmcc.it; sara.leporati@compagniadisanpaolo.it; traina@compagniadisanpaolo.it; paola.mercogliano@cmcc.it,"Ellena, Marta/HGD-4303-2022; Giugliano, Giuseppe/HLH-1364-2023; Ellena, Marta/HHZ-4437-2022","Giugliano, Giuseppe/0000-0001-5172-8411; Ellena, Marta/0000-0003-3272-556X; Barbato, Giuliana/0000-0001-5892-1062; Mercogliano, Paola/0000-0001-7236-010X","Fondazione Compagnia di SanPaolo, Turin, Italy; St Paul Foundation","Fondazione Compagnia di SanPaolo, Turin, Italy(Compagnia di San Paolo); St Paul Foundation","The authors would like to acknowledge the Fondazione Compagnia di SanPaolo, Turin, Italy that facilitated the completion and the funding of this study.

In this study, we investigated the capacity for climate-adaptive management by surveying the community of researchers, administrators, and field managers who are responsible for wildlife conservation in the state of Wisconsin, USA. We specifically measured differences in how these sectors perceive climate change risk, communicate, and make decisions to represent barriers in how they transmit and use research. We frame these barriers within the literature on evidence-based and adaptive management and risk psychology, as principles that underlie climate change adaptation. Almost all respondents agreed that the climate is changing (223/224), but 22% of the respondents were unsure whether climate change is negative for wildlife and field managers dominated this group (68%). Field managers also reported using components of adaptive management more frequently than did other sectors, but all three questioned the importance of one specific component: predicting the consequence of management before implementation. When seeking information, researchers preferred communicating via published literature, but managers and administrators reported a preference for in-person communication. Although only 29% of the respondents were currently involved in climate change work, 77% said they would get involved without additional incentives or direction at work. These results confirm a common pattern of barriers between research and management sectors across all scales of decision-making. Overall, results suggest that in-person and problem-based communication that is focused on real decisions and that utilizes social networks are a way to enable resource management communities to effectively confront these barriers.

Adaptation measures have been identified in literature, but how these can be implemented remains unclear. Current certification programmes have the potential to provide guidance on how sustainability criteria can be addressed and taken up by farmers. We identify climate change adaptation options, their scale of application, and the necessary implementation steps. We show that implementation complexity strongly increases with the degree of climate change. With modest climatic changes, incremental adaptations might suffice, but more substantial climatic change will require radical social-institutional changes for adaptation uptake and interventions. For the majority of smallholders the implementation of any measure is largely constrained by a lack of access to knowledge networks and training material, organisational support, and (mainly financial) resources. A landscape approach that encompasses collective action and coordinated cross-sector planning can overcome some of these barriers. Certification approaches can facilitate a move in this direction. Yet, the implementation of transformative adaptations requires visioning, realignment of policies and incentives, and new market formations. This entails a repositioning and revision of certification schemes to allow for more effective adaptation uptake for the benefit of smallholders and the environment.","[Verburg, Rene; Verweij, Pita] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands; [Rahn, Eric; Ghazoul, Jaboury] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Terr Ecosyst, CHN G 73-1 Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [van Kuijk, Marijke] Univ Utrecht, Dept Biol, Padualaan 8, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands; [van Kuijk, Marijke; Ghazoul, Jaboury] Univ Utrecht, Prince Bernhard Chair Int Nat Conservat, Padualaan 8, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands; [Rahn, Eric] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Hanoi, Vietnam",Utrecht University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Utrecht University; Utrecht University; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT,"Verburg, R (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands.",r.w.verburg@uu.nl,,"Verburg, Rene/0000-0002-1651-8037",,,,,84,32,32,6,49,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,1873-6416,,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

This article offers an interrogation of the discursive politics surrounding the term based on insights from postcolonial theory. By employing a theoretical framework rooted in the concepts of imaginative geographies and discursive violence, this contribution seeks to deconstruct how adaptation is being imagined and promoted by development actors in a Global South context. The underlying study adopts a multisited, institutional ethnography to critically analyze an adaptation project in Sao Tome and Principe (STP) implemented jointly by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the national government. The article presents evidence for how agents of development (re)produce an imaginative geography of the country's vulnerability and engage in a discursive violence that renders project beneficiaries vulnerable on the one hand, and seeks to transform them into model adaptation subjects on the other. It discusses how local residents have been effectively excluded from the project based on their perceived vulnerabilities and points to critical political theory and imaginative countergeographies as ways in which the disempowering representations of the Global South as vulnerable and the discursive violence committed against its residents can be counteracted.","[Mikulewicz, Michael] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Ctr Climate Justice, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland",Glasgow Caledonian University,"Mikulewicz, M (corresponding author), Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Ctr Climate Justice, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland.",michael.mikulewicz@gcu.ac.uk,"Mikulewicz, Michael/AAU-9365-2021",,,,,,107,27,27,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2469-4452,2469-4460,,ANN AM ASSOC GEOGR,Ann.

In this case, indigenous knowledge and information systems play a pivotal role in linking such structures to changing conditions. Taking such role into account, an attempt was made to investigate the nomadic knowledge of local people residing in summer rangelands of Semirom Township in Isfahan Province, Iran, gained in response to climate change. A cluster sampling procedure was used to extract the case study population from a number of nearly 7700 Qashqai nomads divided into four, Dare shoori, Amale, Shesh blocki, and Farsimdan, clans in which grazing systems were recognized as clusters or sampling units. In-depth group interviewing and exploratory methods were then used to assess the role of nomadic indigenous knowledge and insights into utilization of summer rangelands gained on adaptation to climate change and data collected from interviews were analyzed using content analysis. The results showed that people of Qashqai tribes have a thorough knowledge of climate change and have adopted long-term adaptive solutions such as building cement-block houses and water storage ponds as well as changing the migration routes and locations to cope with the adverse consequences of climate change.","[Saboohi, Razieh] Gorgan Univ Agr & Nat Resources, Gorgan, Golestan, Iran; [Barani, Hossein] Gorgan Univ Agr Sci & Nat Resources, Dept Rangeland Management, Gorgan, Golestan, Iran; [Khodagholi, Morteza] AREEO, Res Div Nat Resources, Isfahan Agr & Nat Resources Res & Educ Ctr, Esfahan, Iran; [Sarvestani, Ahmad Abedi] Gorgan Univ Agr Sci & Nat Resources, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Coll Agr Management, Gorgan, Golestan, Iran; [Tahmasebi, Asghar] Kharazmi Univ, Fac Geog, Tehran, Iran",Kharazmi University,"Saboohi, R (corresponding author), Gorgan Univ Agr & Nat Resources, Gorgan, Golestan, Iran.",Razieh_saboohi@yahoo.com; baranihossein@yahoo.com; m_khodagholi@yahoo.com; abediac@yahoo.com; desertcontol@yahoo.com,"Abedi Sarvestani, Ahmad/AAC-7587-2019; Tahmasebi, Asghar/AAX-6369-2020","Abedi Sarvestani, Ahmad/0000-0002-5808-4505; Saboohi, Razieh/0000-0001-5165-570X",,,,,20,9,9,0,11,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

However, if unaccounted for, climate change can undermine the efficacy of such efforts. Despite this, integration of climate change adaptation and resilience into spatial marine conservation and management has been limited in Canada and elsewhere. With climate change impacts becoming increasingly severe, now is the time to anticipate and reduce impacts wherever possible. We provide five recommendations for an inclusive, proactive, climate-ready approach for Canada's growing marine conservation network: (1) integrating climate-resilience as a universal objective of the Canadian Marine Conservation Network, creating and implementing (2) national transdisciplinary working groups with representation from all knowledge holders and (3) necessary tools that integrate climate change into conservation design, (4) defining operational and climate-relevant monitoring and management objectives, and (5) strengthening communication and increasing knowledge exchange around the roles and benefits of protected areas within government and towards the public. Canada's extensive marine and coastal areas reflect national and international responsibility to engage on this issue. Canada is well positioned to assume a leading role in climate change adaptation for marine conservation and help accelerate progress towards international commitments around mitigating ongoing biodiversity loss and climate change.

Yet, climate change impacts will not be contained within country borders, meaning that climate change adaptation governance should also consider borderless climate risks that cascade through the international system, in relatively simple or highly complex ways. In this paper, we demonstrate how the notion of borderless climate risks challenges the dominant territorial framing of adaptation and its problem structure. To advance knowledge, we ask: why has a territorial framing and the national and sub-national scales dominated adaptation governance? How do borderless climate risks challenge this framing and what are possible governance responses? We draw on constructivist international relations theory and propose that the epistemic community that developed to interpret climate change adaptation for decision-makers had certain features (e.g. strong environmental sciences foundation, reliance on place-based case study research) that established and subsequently reinforced the territorial framing. This framing was then reinforced by an international norm that adaptation was primarily a national or local responsibility, which has paradoxically also informed calls for international responsibility for funding adaptation. We conclude by identifying types of governance responses at three different scales-national and bilateral; transnational; international and regional-and invite more systematic evaluation by the IR community.","[Benzie, Magnus; Persson, Asa] Stockholm Environm Inst, Box 24218, S-10451 Stockholm, Sweden; [Persson, Asa] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden",Stockholm Environment Institute; Linkoping University,"Benzie, M (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Box 24218, S-10451 Stockholm, Sweden.",magnus.benzie@sei.org,"Persson, Åsa/ABD-8096-2021","Persson, Asa/0000-0002-8886-5046",Swedish Research Council Formas [211-2012-1842]; Mistra Geopolitics research programme,Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); Mistra Geopolitics research programme,"This research was funded by the Swedish Research Council Formas, Grant No. 211-2012-1842 Climate adaptation in a globalised world and the Mistra Geopolitics research programme.

In South Africa, it is increasingly apparent that delays in responding to climate change over the past decades have jeopardized human life and livelihoods. While slow progress with mitigation, especially in the energy sector, has garnered much attention, focus is now shifting to developing plans and systems to adapt to the impacts of climate change.MethodsWe applied systematic review methods to assess progress with climate change adaptation in the health sector in South Africa. This case study provides useful lessons which could be applied in other countries in the African region, or globally. We reviewed the literature indexed in PubMed and Web of Science, together with relevant grey literature. We included articles describing adaptation interventions to reduce the impact of climate change on health in South Africa. All study designs were eligible. Data from included articles and grey literature were summed thematically.ResultsOf the 820 publications screened, 21 were included, together with an additional xx papers. Very few studies presented findings of an intervention or used high-quality research designs. Several policy frameworks for climate change have been developed at national and local government levels. These, however, pay little attention to health concerns and the specific needs of vulnerable groups. Systems for forecasting extreme weather, and tracking malaria and other infections appear well established. Yet, there is little evidence about the country's preparedness for extreme weather events, or the ability of the already strained health system to respond to these events. Seemingly, few adaptation measures have taken place in occupational and other settings. To date, little attention has been given to climate change in training curricula for health workers.ConclusionsOverall, the volume and quality of research is disappointing, and disproportionate to the threat posed by climate change in South Africa. This is surprising given that the requisite expertise for policy advocacy, identifying effective interventions and implementing systems-based approaches rests within the health sector. More effective use of data, a traditional strength of health professionals, could support adaptation and promote accountability of the state. With increased health-sector leadership, climate change could be reframed as predominately a health issue, one necessitating an urgent, adequately-resourced response. Such a shift in South Africa, but also beyond the country, may play a key role in accelerating climate change adaptation and mitigation.","[Chersich, Matthew F.] Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Hlth Sci, Wits Reprod Hlth & HIV Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Wright, Caradee Y.] Univ Pretoria, South African Med Res Council, Environm & Hlth Res Unit, Pretoria, South Africa; [Wright, Caradee Y.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand; South African Medical Research Council; University of Pretoria; University of Pretoria,"Chersich, MF (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Hlth Sci, Wits Reprod Hlth & HIV Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa.",mchersich@wrhi.ac.za,,"chersich, matthew/0000-0002-4320-9168",,,,,92,25,25,10,24,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1744-8603,,GLOBALIZATION HEALTH,Global.

The semi-autonomous polity faces challenges to foster resilient urban communities and planning for mitigation and adaptation to climate change, not least because of its island nature and rapid urbanization. This article addresses urban and environmental planning measures from 2010 to 2020 aimed at confronting the impacts of climate change and working toward resilience and adaptation in urban Zanzibar. The study was conducted between June and August 2020, and primarily involved a combination of desktop studies, online discussions, and virtual meetings with key actors in the land, climate, and disaster risk policy and governance aspects in Zanzibar. The review provides information on the current responses to policy, legal and institutional setup in terms of the key issues related to land use, climate and disaster risk reduction in Zanzibar. Thematic analysis was used to connect land-use planning, climate adaptation, and disaster risk reduction documentation of the situational assessment, determination and respective recommendations concerning land use and climate adaptation. It is argued that planning for climate change requires greater social will, financial investment, and the conversion of science to policy than currently exists in Zanzibar. Dynamic individual and governmental efforts and select community engagement are likely insufficient to produce resilience, as large-scale donor-funded climate adaptation interventions are largely top-down in orientation and often miss out on local community-oriented climate solutions. Smaller NGOs are more practical for understanding and addressing community-oriented priorities to support climate-resilient initiatives and enhance local livelihood priorities and participation against climate impacts, including natural disasters and everyday degradation. The article concludes with policy recommendations both specific to Zanzibar and relevant across the region.","[Myers, Garth] Trinity Coll, Urban Int Studies, Ctr Urban & Global Studies, 300 Summit St, Hartford, CT 06106 USA; [Myers, Garth] Trinity Coll, Ctr Urban & Global Studies, 300 Summit St, Hartford, CT 06106 USA; [Walz, Jonathan] Sch Int Training, Grad Inst, Climate & Environm, Brattleboro, VT USA; [Walz, Jonathan] Sch Int Training, Grad Inst, Climate & Environm, Zanzibar, Tanzania; [Walz, Jonathan] POB 3040 Vuga, Zanzibar, Tanzania; [Jumbe, Aboud] Govt Zanzibar, Dept Environm, POB 628, Zanzibar, Tanzania",Trinity College; Trinity College,"Myers, G (corresponding author), Trinity Coll, Urban Int Studies, Ctr Urban & Global Studies, 300 Summit St, Hartford, CT 06106 USA.;Myers, G (corresponding author), Trinity Coll, Ctr Urban & Global Studies, 300 Summit St, Hartford, CT 06106 USA.",garth.myers@trincoll.edu; jwalz.us@gmail.com; aboud.jumbe@gmail.com,,,,,,,62,0,0,3,10,"UNIV FREE STATE, DEPT TOWN & REGIONAL PLANNING",BLOEMFONTEIN,"PO BOX 339, BLOEMFONTEIN, 9300, SOUTH AFRICA",1012-280X,2415-0495,,TOWN REG PLAN,Town Reg.

Taking urban planning in Johannesburg as a case study and using the risks of flooding as an illustrative example, this qualitative study explores how adaptation synergies can be realised in planning practices. In this specific case, significant synergy possibilities in planning practices are not observed. Instead, political challenges of reconciling adaptation measures with planning responses to the considerable developmental challenges of urban divide and multiple urban risks in Johannesburg substantially limit the response space for adaptation practices, including those achievable through synergies. Insights gained in this study underline the necessity of giving greater attention to the empirics of observed synergies.

The use of unsuitable water sources for irrigation may increase salinisation risks. However, few if any policy assessments and research efforts have been directed at investigating how farmer perceptions mediate spillovers from the ubiquitous irrigation adaptation strategy. In this study, the cognitive failure and/or bias construct is examined and proposed as an analytical lens in research, policy, and learning and the convergence of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation discourses. A cross-sectional survey design and multistage stratified sampling were used to collect data from 69 households. To elicit the environmental impacts of irrigation practices, topsoil and subsoils from irrigated and non-irrigated sites were sampled and analysed using AAS (atomic absorption spectrophotometer). A generalised linear logistic weight estimation procedure was used to analyse the perception of risks while an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyse changes in exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP). The findings from small-scale farmers in Machakos and Kakamega counties, Kenya, suggest multifaceted biases and failures about the existence and importance of externalities in adaptation planning discourses. Among other dimensions, a cognitive failure which encompasses fragmented approaches among institutions for use and management of resources, inadequate policy. and information support, as well as the poor integration of actors in adaptation planning accounts for adaptation failure. The failures in such human-environment system interactions have the potential to exacerbate the existing vulnerability of farmer production systems in the long run. The findings further suggest that in absence of risk message information dissemination, education level, farming experience, and information accumulation, as integral elements to human capital, do not seem to have a significant effect on behaviour concerning the mitigation of environmental spillovers. Implicitly, reversing the inherent adaptation failures calls for system approaches that enhance coordinated adaptation planning, prioritise the proactive mitigation of slow-onset disaster risks, and broadens decision support systems such as risk information dissemination integration, into the existing adaptation policy discourses and practice.","[Elijah, Volenzo Tom; Odiyo, John O.] Univ Venda, Dept Hydrol & Water Resources, Sch Environm Sci, ZA-0950 Thohoyandou, South Africa",University of Venda,"Elijah, VT (corresponding author), Univ Venda, Dept Hydrol & Water Resources, Sch Environm Sci, ZA-0950 Thohoyandou, South Africa.",volenztom@gmail.com; john.odiyo@univen.ac.za,"Volenzo, elijah/X-4871-2019","Odiyo, John Ogony/0000-0002-0612-2303",,,,,123,2,2,1,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,JAN,2020,8,1,,,,,,,3,10.3390/cli8010003,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli8010003,,,26,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,KL6CT,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000513510000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aims to examine the impact of key psychological variables in the Theory of Reasoned Action, the Theory of Planned Behavior, an Extended Parallel Process Model and the Social Cognitive Theory on the intention of schoolchildren to engage in climate change adaptation behavior-in this study, practices which would help reduce the risks of contracting dengue fever. It also seeks to identify the most salient predictors of the behavioral intention across these theories. Data were obtained from 796 Vietnamese schoolchildren who completed questionnaires measuring constructs of the four theories. Multivariate data analysis demonstrated that self-efficacy and severity appeared to be significant and consistent predictors of the individual's intention to reduce dengue fever. The results provide practical suggestions for the use of the theorical constructs tested in climate change communication campaigns in Vietnam and insights generally on pro-environmental behavior change.","[Nguyen, Quynh Anh] Natl Inst Sci & Technol Policy & Strategy Study N, 38 Ngo Quyen, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Hens, Luc] Univ Nova Lisboa, Dept Human Ecol, Campus Campolide, P-1099085 Lisbon, Portugal; [Nguyen, Ninh] La Trobe Univ, La Trobe Business Sch, Dept Econ Finance & Mkt, Plenty Rd, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia; [Nguyen, Ninh] Thuongmai Univ, Business Sustainabil Res Grp, 79 Ho Tung Mau Rd, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam; [MacAlister, Charlotte] Int Dev Res Ctr IDRC, 150 Kent St, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Lebel, Louis] Chiang Mai Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Unit Social & Environm Res USER, 239 Huay Kaew Rd, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; La Trobe University; Thuongmai University; Chiang Mai University,"Nguyen, QA (corresponding author), Natl Inst Sci & Technol Policy & Strategy Study N, 38 Ngo Quyen, Hanoi, Vietnam.;Nguyen, N (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, La Trobe Business Sch, Dept Econ Finance & Mkt, Plenty Rd, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.;Nguyen, N (corresponding author), Thuongmai Univ, Business Sustainabil Res Grp, 79 Ho Tung Mau Rd, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam.",anh.quynh.nguyen@gmail.com; ninhnguyen@tmu.edu.vn,"Nguyen, The Ninh/R-2900-2019; Lebel, Louis/D-4130-2014","Nguyen, The Ninh/0000-0001-6050-2633; Lebel, Louis/0000-0001-6187-6418","International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada [106707-001]","International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada(CGIAR)","This research was funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada, grant number [106707-001].",,90,6,6,3,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0364-152X,1432-1009,,ENVIRON MANAGE,Environ.

Deltaic areas, in which millions of farmers cultivate from one to three crops of rice per year, are susceptible also to the impacts of a rising sea level, submergence during major storm events, and saline intrusion into groundwater and surface water resources. In this paper, I review the current state of knowledge regarding the potential impacts of climate change on rice production and I describe adaptation measures that involve soil and water management. In many areas, farmers will need to modify crop choices, crop calendars, and soil and water management practices as they adapt to climate change. Adaptation measures at the local, regional, and international levels also will be helpful in moderating the potential impacts of climate change on aggregate rice production and on household food security in many countries. Some of the changes in soil and water management and other production practices that will be implemented in response to climate change also will reduce methane generation and release from rice fields. Some of the measures also will reduce the uptake of arsenic in rice plants, thus addressing an important public health issue in portions of South and Southeast Asia. Where feasible, replacing continuously flooded rice production with some form of aerobic rice production, will contribute to achieving adaptation objectives, while also reducing global warming potential and minimizing the risk of negative health impacts due to consumption of arsenic contaminated rice.","[Wichelns, Dennis] Asia Ctr, Stockholm Environm Inst, Bangkok 10330, Thailand",,"Wichelns, D (corresponding author), Asia Ctr, Stockholm Environm Inst, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",dennis.wichelns@sei-international.org,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,,,,,314,9,9,2,109,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,APR,2016,8,4,,,,,,,141,10.3390/w8040141,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w8040141,,,39,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,DK8DK,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-03-25,WOS:000375157200032,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mainstreaming' climate information, policies and measures into ongoing development planning and decision-making has been proposed as one solution, seen as making more sustainable, effective and efficient use of resources than designing and managing climate policies separately from ongoing development activities. But what does mainstreaming look like in practice? This article explores the process of mainstreaming, drawing on the country case study of Bangladesh, one of the countries that have made significant progress on adaptation planning and mainstreaming. The article begins by making the case for mainstreaming, by exploring the linkages and trade-offs between adaptation and development and describing the various approaches to mainstreaming from the literature. Second, it considers how to implement mainstreaming in practice, reviewing an existing four-step framework. Examining this framework against the plethora of mainstreaming experiences in Bangladesh, the article considers how the framework can be used as a tool for assessing the progress of mainstreaming progress in Bangladesh. The article concludes that while the framework is useful for considering some of the preconditions necessary for getting mainstreaming underway, experiences of mainstreaming in Bangladesh reflect a much more complex patchwork of processes and stakeholders that need to be taken into consideration in further research on this topic.

Moreover, the costs associated with investments in reduced vulnerability to climatic events are likely to exhibit economies of scope. We explore the implications of these characteristics on farmer's decisions to adapt to climate change using a framed field experiment applied to coffee farmers in Costa Rica. As expected, we find high levels of risk aversion, but even using that as a baseline, we further find that farmers behave even more cautiously when the setting is characterized by unknown or ambiguous risk (i.e. poor or non-reliable risk information). Secondly, we find that farmers, to a large extent, coordinated their decisions to secure a lower adaptation cost, and that communication among farmers strongly facilitated coordination.

Farmers, organizations and Governments in the region have developed policies and innovations to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. It appears that the developed and implemented innovative adaptive farming systems and technologies have culminated into resultant overall productivity improvement in farming systems, necessitating scaling up in order to widely strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of vulnerable communities to the impacts of climate change. Additionally, climate governance instruments that are aligned to the ratified international treaties have been developed and related programs have been rolled out in different countries. This offers hope for well-coordinated efforts and interventions for the mitigation and adaptation to the adverse impacts of climate change on the environment and livelihoods. Observably, there is a pressing need to scale up climate smart innovations sustainably through creation of an enabling policy environment, capacity building, and conducting climate change related research and outreach, and effective dissemination of climate technologies and information, especially in remote areas in the region. Since climate change is a global issue, local initiatives and actions for mitigating and adapting to the adverse impacts ought to be well integrated into the broader international context.","[Afokpe, Pamela M.

Traditional actors such as governments and international organizations leave deficits in norm development, enforcement, capacity building, and financing. Orchestration has been suggested under the functionalist assumption that transnational actors can make up for these deficits, through optimizing complementarity between the realms of international and transnational governance and through eliciting more action toward the achievement of globally agreed climate goals. In the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), orchestration has taken the form of an evolving Global Climate Action Agenda (GCAA). Few studies have examined the role of orchestration in bolstering transnational adaptation. This article therefore asks: Has the GCAA effectively mobilized and prioritized transnational adaptation action? Further, has it effectively addressed functional, participatory, and geographic deficits? Analyzing a unique dataset of a hundred cooperative climate actions, this study finds that current patterns are incongruent with some functionalist expectations. GCAA orchestration has featured a political prioritization of both adaptation and mitigation and a focus on building a positive narrative of climate action. This combination of priorities has led to neglect of underperforming actions-many of them adaptation actions in developing countries. Subsequent iterations of the GCAA failed to recognize these actions and did not identify support needed for them. This has strengthened the bias toward mitigation aspects of climate change and exacerbated imbalances in the geography of transnational action under the GCAA.","[Chan, Sander] DIE, German Dev Inst, Bonn, Germany; [Chan, Sander] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands",Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE); Utrecht University,"Chan, S (corresponding author), DIE, German Dev Inst, Bonn, Germany.",sander.chan@die-gdi.de,,"Chan, Sander/0000-0001-7852-3838",Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),"We wish to thank Dr. Robert Falkner, Research Director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environmentand Associate Professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), with whom an earlier version of the GAFCA database was developed.

To do so, a selection model generalizing the Heckman (1979) approach and the Oaxaca and Blinder decomposition procedure are specified and estimated. The empirical analysis is based on intra-agricultural household data from the 2018 Harmonized Household Living Conditions Survey (EHCVM) of Togo with a total sample of 8622 maize plots disaggregated by seasonThe results reveal that the average maize productivity of men is about 23.5% higher than that of women. Similarly, the average maize productivity of married women is about 28.5% higher than that of unmarried women. This suggests that married men and women have greater adaptive capacity than their counterparts and are also more likely to improve their productivity. The factors that contribute to the performance of married men and women at the expense of their counterparts are secondary education, producer assets, and climate information. We also find that the use of improved seeds, off-season cropping, and a combination of both strategies are the types of coping strategies adopted by men and married women to increase their productivity. These results have implications for the direction of development policies. These development policies can be more targeted at unmarried women.","[Koudjom, Etayibtalnam] Univ Lome, Lab Agr Econ & Appl Macroecon LEAMA, Lome, Togo",,"Koudjom, E (corresponding author), Univ Lome, Lab Agr Econ & Appl Macroecon LEAMA, Lome, Togo.",emmakoudjom@gmail.com,,,"UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) [60925]","UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO)","This research is part of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) project on Macroeconomic Research in Low-Income Countries (Project ID: 60925) supported by the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO).",,45,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Alongside and intermingled with opportunistic migration there has always been relocation to escape, particularly from calamity, disaster and warfare. As climate change is considered a likely driver of migration, the literature encompasses a debate as to whether or not migration can be considered to be adaptation. This paper investigates the concept of voluntary within-country migration as an adaptation strategy to reduce disaster risk in Australia. We refer to this internal migration as relocation. The paper examines results of research carried out in Australia at the time of recent and extensive disasters, where opportunities were presented to examine household attitudes towards relocation in the face of future disasters of similar extent. Individuals' attitudes towards relocation were ascertained within an adaptation and mitigation context, at a time of emerging longer term climate change government policy that advocates retreat from hazard prone locations. The paper examines demographic data to reveal who is likely to leave or stay. Policy implications of relocation strategies as climate change adaptation strategy within a developed nation are discussed. This research concludes that relocation is a strategy available to some as part of an extensive range of responses to extreme weather events but undertaking unsupported resettlement is not always an option for reasons of family commitment, livelihood opportunities, financial constraints and emotional lies. Those who remain, and those who leave a hazard prone location may both demonstrate a capacity for adaptation and resilience. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

These types of adjustments, henceforth referred to as non-technological, are not only more feasible in the resource-constrained situation of smallholder farmers but also have a potential to significantly reduce the negative impact of climate change. However, a systematic study of these types of adaptations isolating them from technological ones is still lacking. While technological adaptations can benefit from the extensive literature on the adoption of agricultural technologies, non-technological adaptations still need further examination as one distinct group of adjustments. We hypothesize that this group of adaptations strongly depend on farmers' accumulated experience rather than financial resources and level of schooling. To test this hypothesis, we compared the determinants of changing planting date and changing crop type as non-technological adaptations, with the determinants of two technological adaptations: fertilizer use and rainwater harvesting. The investigation relied on a survey of 270 farm households in Semien Shewa Zone of Ethiopia. We used Wilcoxon Signed rank test and verified the importance of climate change in inducing the adjustments. A Multivariate probit model was then used to identify their determinants. Our hypothesis is supported by a positive relationship between farm experience and changing planting date, while fertilizer and rainwater harvesting showed a positive correlation with access to credit and level of schooling respectively. Our findings suggest that targeting non-technological farm-level adaptations through interventions focused on experience sharing can alone play an important role in reducing the impact of climate change in agriculture.","[Tessema, Yibekal Abebe; Joerin, Jonas; Patt, Anthony] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Climate Policy Grp, Univ Str 22, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Tessema, YA (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Climate Policy Grp, Univ Str 22, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",ytessema@student.ethz.ch; jonas.joerin@usys.ethz.ch; anthony.patt@usys.ethz.ch,"Tessema, Yibekal Abebe/GMX-3568-2022","Tessema, Yibekal Abebe/0000-0003-1682-1850; Joerin, Jonas/0000-0003-1834-8112",Swiss Government,Swiss Government,"I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship program for covering my expenses during my Ph.D. study at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.",,70,15,16,3,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2211-4645,2211-4653,,ENVIRON DEV,Environ.

With no ambitious mitigation, recent years have witnessed an increasing frequency of extreme climate events, including cross-border or borderless climate risks. Accordingly, the Paris Agreement frames adaptation as a global goal and global responsibility. However, financing for adaptation continues to remain extremely poor, relative to the estimated needs, even though the regime has obligatory provisions for support by developed countries. Why is this so? Why should the majority of the countries, with an insignificant contribution to causing the problem, suffer from increasing climate impacts? How can adaptation finance be enhanced at scale? As a response to these queries, the paper substantiates three claims: (1) that poor funding can be attributed to the territorial framing under the regime that conceptualizes adaptation largely as a local or national public good and, hence, the inefficacy of market mechanisms, (2) that it makes conceptual and political sense to consider adaptation as a global public good, and (3) that such a reframing should make a difference in boosting adaptation finance. In a multi-polar world with different views on adaptation finance, multilateral agencies should lead in promoting the proposed framing.","[Khan, Mizan R.] Independent Univ, Int Ctr Climate Change & Dev ICCCAD, Dhaka 1229, Bangladesh; [Munira, Sirazoom] North South Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Management, Dhaka 1229, Bangladesh",Independent University Bangladesh (IUB); North South University (NSU),"Munira, S (corresponding author), North South Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Management, Dhaka 1229, Bangladesh.",mizan.khan@icccad.org; sirazoom.munira@northsouth.edu,,,,,,,102,3,3,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Yet diverse approaches to institutional analysis are available, encompassing different ontological and epistemological assumptions, and thus yielding insights on very different aspects of institutions in adaptation. Therefore, efforts to expand knowledge in this domain can be usefully informed by an assessment of approaches to institutional analysis in the adaptation literature, which is to date lacking. We address this gap by conducting a systematic review of the adaptation literature addressing institutions. Our review characterises approaches to institutional analysis by identifying methodological choices and the philosophy of science underpinning them. We then analyze the distribution of approaches to institutional analysis across different adaptation situations, contextualizing our results within methodological debates in adaptation research regarding the appropriateness of positivist, interpretative, or post-normal approaches. We find that institutional analysis of adaptation is now engaging with 'how' and 'why' questions, beyond descriptive questions that characterise the adaptation 'barriers' literature, that diverse philosophies of science drive methodological choice, and that post-normal approaches, e.g. co-design approaches, hardly address institutions. We conclude that support for interpretative approaches, and for institutional analysis in post-normal approaches is needed. The latter is important for adaptation planning processes in developing countries under the UNFCCC.","[Bisaro, Alexander] Global Climate Forum, Neue Promenade 6, D-10178 Berlin, Germany; [Roggero, Matteo] Humboldt Univ, Resource Econ Grp, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Villannayor-Tomas, Sergio] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, Edifici Z,Campus UAB, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Humboldt University of Berlin; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Bisaro, A (corresponding author), Global Climate Forum, Neue Promenade 6, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",sandy.bisaro@globalclimatefonun.org,,"Bisaro, Alexander/0000-0003-4281-0012",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program through the project GREEN-WIN [642018]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [FKZ 03EK3523C]; European Commission [660089-COMOVE],European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program through the project GREEN-WIN; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),This research has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program through the project GREEN-WIN (Grant agreement No 642018) and from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) (Grant agreement FKZ 03EK3523C).

This study uses an extreme warm spell that occurred during a survey of Michigan residents to evaluate the influence of complex temperature effects on public support for government involvement in the agricultural sector's adaptation to climate change. Comparison of several alternatives for capturing the influence of temperature fluctuations on survey responses (some drawn from the literature, some newly constructed) shows a temporary increase in support for government assistance for adaptation after the onset of a warm spell, but a longer exposure to extreme temperatures does not necessarily lead to more support for adaptation policies. Conditional on other attributes of temperature abnormalities (e.g., direction of trend), abnormal heat might even lead to reduced support for adaptation policies.","[Lee, Gi-Eu] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Loveridge, Scott] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Winkler, Julie A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Lee, GE (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",gieul@unr.edu; loverid2@msu.edu; winkler@msu.edu,"Lee, Gi-Eu/AAO-7671-2021",,Michigan Applied Public Policy Research Program; National Science Foundation [NSF BCS 0909378],Michigan Applied Public Policy Research Program; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This study was funded by the Michigan Applied Public Policy Research Program and the National Science Foundation (Grant #NSF BCS 0909378).

Indigenous transport drivers were surveyed face-to-face in Bandung, Indonesia, and in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, to gain an understanding of how transport workers, specifically drivers-operators, characterize transport modes considered as indigenous and perceive their potential role in increasing the adaptive capacity of these cities. The main finding was that indigenous transport modes in the two cities in the case study had evolved to fit a niche market influenced by differing urban scales and divergent demographic and geographic characteristics. Thus, the experiences and the perceptions of transport workers on indigenous transport were highly contextualized in relation to service and route characteristics. Operating conditions for drivers were indicative of the regulatory status of indigenous transport modes in the informal landscape. This analysis contributes to an increased understanding of the role and the operation of indigenous transport modes within the transport system. The analysis also contributes policy-relevant insights to improve an understanding of the potential role of indigenous transport in climate change adaptation, as well as to increase awareness and to anticipate a shift to a more environmentally sustainable transport mode.","[Ames, Alicia; Mateo-Babiano, Iderlina B.] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Susilo, Yusak O.] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Dept Transport Sci, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",University of Queensland; Royal Institute of Technology,"Mateo-Babiano, IB (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, St Lucia Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",i.mateobabiano@uq.edu.au,"Susilo, Yusak O/M-3707-2013; Mateo-Babiano, Iderlina/B-1027-2012","Susilo, Yusak O/0000-0001-7124-7164; Mateo-Babiano, Iderlina/0000-0001-9097-2126",Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies; University of Queensland,Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies; University of Queensland(University of Queensland),The authors thank the support of the Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies for funding this project and the research opportunity provided by the University of Queensland's summer research scholarship program.,,31,2,2,2,7,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0361-1981,2169-4052,,TRANSPORT RES REC,Transp.

Trade has also reduced manufacturing wages in high income countries and made entire industries uncompetitive in some communities, giving rise to nationalist politics that seek to stop or reverse further trade expansion in the United States and Europe. Given complex and uncertain political support for trade, how might changes in trade policy affect the global food system's ability to adapt to climate change? Here we argue that we can best understand food security in a changing climate as a double exposure: the exposure of people and processes to both economic and climate-related shocks and stressors. Trade can help us adapt to climate change, or not. If trade restrictions proliferate, double exposure to both a rapidly changing climate and volatile markets will likely jeopardize the food security of millions. A changing climate will present both opportunities and challenges for the global food system, and adapting to its many impacts will affect food availability, food access, food utilization and food security stability for the poorest people across the world. Global trade can continue to play a central role in assuring that global food system adapts to a changing climate. This potential will only be realized, however, if trade is managed in ways that maximize the benefits of broadened access to new markets while minimizing the risks of increased exposure to international competition and market volatility. For regions like Africa, for example, enhanced transportation networks combined with greater national reserves of cash and enhanced social safety nets could reduce the impact of 'double exposure' on food security.

This paper presents the results of a study into how herder communities adapt to climate change and the potential role an ecosystem services approach could play in informing the development of effective adaptation strategies. The findings are based on semi-structured interviews with herders, key informants, focus group discussions and a survey of nomadic households in Northeast Mongolia. The benefits of pasture ecosystem services have changed considerably due to climatic and socio-economic changes in the Mongolian steppe resulting in degradation of the pastureland and water resources. The ways that traditional ecological knowledge and practices can support adaptation to climate change are explored. In particular, the seasonal movement of nomads represents a valuable form of knowledge and practice of adaptation in response to the changes in temperate dryland ecosystems. To continue to maintain mobility as part of adaptation strategies other adaptation actions are required, such as the implementation of an appropriate livestock insurance systems that addresses climate and weather risks, and restoration of dryland ecosystem services, notably through reforestation and improvement of water supplies. Further changes in the pastureland ecosystems may lead to further adaptations in nomadic livelihoods, leveraging nomadic herders' knowledge of local ecosystem services.","[Tugjamba, Navchaa; Walkerden, Greg; Miller, Fiona] Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Macquarie University,"Tugjamba, N (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",navchaa.tugjamba@mq.edu.au,"Tugjamba, Navchaa/AAK-4246-2021","Tugjamba, Navchaa/0000-0001-8436-3068; Miller, Fiona/0000-0003-4427-6466; Walkerden, Greg/0000-0001-5520-7090",Macquarie University through the International Macquarie Research Excellence Scholarship program (iMQRES),Macquarie University through the International Macquarie Research Excellence Scholarship program (iMQRES),This research study was supported by Macquarie University through the International Macquarie Research Excellence Scholarship program (iMQRES) to the first author<BOLD>.</BOLD> We thank all participants who generously shared their precious time and valuable knowledge and experiences of human and nature relations.,,65,4,4,5,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,APR 3,2021,26,4,,,,,411,430,,10.1080/13549839.2021.1891032,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2021.1891032,,FEB 2021,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,RS4ZK,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000620574500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We sought to assess how the psychosocial consequences of a major event were addressed via public health responses (e.g., programs, policies, and practices) that aimed to enhance, protect, and promote mental health. Methods We report on a study of health and social service responses to the long-term mental health impacts of the 2013 Southern Alberta flood, in High River, Alberta. Qualitative research methods included (i) telephone interviews (n = 14) with key informant health and social services leaders, (ii) four focus group sessions with front-line health and social services workers (n = 14), and (iii) semi-structured interviews with a sample of community members (n = 18) who experienced the flood. We conducted a descriptive thematic analysis, with a focus on participants' perceptions and experiences. Results Findings of this study suggest (1) the long-term psychosocial impacts of extreme weather and climate change require sustained recovery interventions rooted in local knowledge and interdisciplinary action; (2) there are unintended consequences related to psychosocial interventions that can incite complex emotions and impact psychosocial recovery; and (3) perceptions of mental health care, among people exposed to climate-related trauma, can guide climate change and mental health response and recovery interventions.

To adapt to climate change and avoid yield loss, a possible strategy may be to increase moisture loss from the seedbed, in contrast to earlier seedbed research, which has focused on minimising moisture loss. In this study, we compared light and heavy mechanisation alternatives for secondary tillage in an experiment with relatively dry and excess moisture conditions. The mechanisation alternatives' suitability for excess moisture conditions was assessed in terms of resultant aggregate size distribution, penetration resistance, bulk density, air-filled porosity, air permeability, soil moisture content and cereal emergence. In general, lighter mechanisation created more favourable seedbed characteristics and seemed to be more suitable under excess soil moisture conditions. Larger aggregates after heavier mechanisation did not result in lower soil moisture content, probably because of compaction in the seedbed. We conclude that, under Norwegian conditions, the most important adaptation to climate change in seedbed preparation for spring cereals is the avoidance of compaction. Implement management for seedbed preparation should be more differentiated.","[Kolberg, Dorothee; Endrerud, Hans Christian] Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Dept Agr Sci, POB 400, NO-2418 Elverum, Norway; [Kolberg, Dorothee; Borresen, Trond] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway",Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Kolberg, D (corresponding author), Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Dept Agr Sci, POB 400, NO-2418 Elverum, Norway.;Kolberg, D (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway.",dorothee.kolberg@nmbu.no,,,Research Council of Norway under the Research Programme on Sustainable Innovation in Food and Bio-based Industries [225330]; Kverneland Group Operation Norway AS,Research Council of Norway under the Research Programme on Sustainable Innovation in Food and Bio-based Industries(Research Council of Norway); Kverneland Group Operation Norway AS,"This study was funded by the Research Council of Norway under the Research Programme on Sustainable Innovation in Food and Bio-based Industries [project number 225330], Hedmark County, Hamar Municipality and Kverneland Group Operation Norway AS.",,59,0,0,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",0906-4710,1651-1913,,ACTA AGR SCAND B-S P,Acta Agric.

Adaptation policies are being adopted by governments at a rapid pace, particularly in Europe. In the period 2005-2010, the total number of recorded adaptation policy measures in the EU grew by some 635%. Despite the plethora of work on adaptation governance, few if any empirical studies have been conducted that explore the driving forces behind the rapid adoption and diffusion of adaptation policies. Working within the theoretical framework of national policy innovation (see Jordan and Huitema, 2014a,b), we draw on a uniquely systematic database of national climate polices to develop a set of hypotheses on the drivers and barriers surrounding the adoption and diffusion of climate change adaptation policies across 29 European countries. Using an internal/external model we postulate that adaptation is largely being driven by internal factors. Additionally, we look to the possible effects of this policy adoption and diffusion to see if adaptation is emerging into a new and distinct policy field. What we find is that indeed it could be in a handful of countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed research agenda is framed using the theory of reflexive modernization to enable the forest research community to consider how different modes of knowledge production can support adaptation within SFM. The workshop discussions highlighted the importance of considering extreme events and high uncertainty in planning for adaptation within SFM. Participants discussed the utility of climate change modeling and risk assessment for local decision-making. In addition, there was general agreement that adaptive collaborative management could facilitate adaptation within SFM, despite difficulties in implementation. The recommendations for future research that emerged from the workshop focused on climate change-related assessments, modeling techniques, and governance and institutional enablers/barriers to adaptation. This broad research agenda, however, can be approached using different modes of knowledge production, illustrating different orders of reflexivity. Apart from a call for more traditional academic research to improve SFM under climate change, workshop participants referred to the need for participatory research, in which researchers would be embedded in communities and other contexts of application, engaging in a client-focused partnership model to produce knowledge that is robust, compelling, legitimate and, above all, locally relevant. It is hoped that this alternative mode of knowledge production would result in a social license and greater political will to accelerate adaptation within SFM.","[Klenk, Nicole L.; Bull, Gary Q.; Innes, John L.; Larson, Bruce C.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Forest Sci Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Cohen, Stewart J.] Univ British Columbia, AIRS, Environm Canada, Located Dept Forest Resources Management,Fac Fore, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of British Columbia; Environment & Climate Change Canada; University of British Columbia,"Klenk, NL (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Forest Sci Ctr, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",nklenk@forestry.ubc.ca,"Klenk, Nicole/ABF-8239-2020; Innes, John L/E-4355-2013","Innes, John L/0000-0002-7076-1222; Klenk, Nicole Lisa/0000-0001-8224-6992",Faculty of Forestry at the University of British Columbia; Adaptation and Impacts Research Section at Environment Canada,Faculty of Forestry at the University of British Columbia; Adaptation and Impacts Research Section at Environment Canada,"Thank you to James Ian MacLellan for providing comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.

Due to failure of top-down approaches, international organisations such as the adaptation fund are now demanding direct involvement of local actors when funding adaptation actions. Direct access mechanisms have been developed to facilitate channelling fund from the international to local levels. At this level, civil society, public and private organisations have a key role to play to assist adaptation among vulnerable groups. But are local organisations ready to play that role in developing countries? In this paper, we develop and apply a framework to measure adaptive capacity among local organisations. Through extensive fieldwork in South Africa, we assessed the capacity of local organisations to develop and implement CCA projects, and thus access international funds for adaptation. Results highlight key determinants of adaptive capacity and identify areas to prioritise for capacity-building interventions. Key findings include strengthening local organisations' effectiveness (e.g. resources, project management capacity) and flexibility; raising awareness about adaptation and its links with socio-economic development; and promoting partnerships and knowledge networks as pathways to build adaptive capacity among local organisations in South Africa.","[Baudoin, Marie-Ange] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat ACDI, Level 6,Geol Sci Bldg,13 Lib Rd,Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Ziervogel, Gina] Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Baudoin, MA (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat ACDI, Level 6,Geol Sci Bldg,13 Lib Rd,Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",marie-ange.baudoin@uct.ac.za; gina@csag.uct.ac.za,"Ziervogel, Gina/AAG-2945-2019","Ziervogel, Gina/0000-0003-4219-6809",University of Cape Town,University of Cape Town,"This paper is part of an ongoing research 'Measuring and tracking adaptive capacity among local organisations in South Africa', funded by the University of Cape Town.

However, few have reported on the innovative institutions developed by some rural communities to rebuild community cooperation and rural adaptive capacity. This paper draws on four comparative cases from the Tibetan Plateau to assess how locally developed community cooperative institutions mediate herders' access to markets and resources to foster adaptive capacity and adaptation in response to snow-related catastrophes. Results demonstrate that community cooperative institutions are more effective in improving adaptive capacity than the market-based adaptation strategies that are the predetermined outcome of individualized tenure regimes. When such cooperative institutions exist, community members are able to apply both household and community collective adaptation strategies, resulting in better livelihood outcomes. Community cooperative institutions effectively address individual needs and priorities by clarifying entitlements and market-based networks. They rebuild community collective action and cooperative business entities that improve herders' ability to access resources and markets more equally by distributing benefits to all community members. This study concludes that following the establishment of individualized land tenure regimes, rebuilding community cooperation necessitates hybridization of property rights arrangements, reformed institutions, and social networks operating across levels of governance to facilitate interdependent interactions between collective and individual adaptation strategies. Such community cooperation offers new opportunities for improving adaptive capacity in pastoral regions and elsewhere.Key policy insightsMarket-based institutions and adaptation strategies are significant components of climate adaptation policies in pastoral and agricultural regions, though they face equity and collective action-building challenges.Adaptative capacity should be understood as a function of cross-level interactions among individuals, community organizations, and external stakeholders.These cases of community cooperative institutions offer new insights into coordinating the interactions between individual-level and community-level adaptation practices.Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) institutions can restore collective management of natural resources and stimulate formal economic cooperation to build bridging networks with other stakeholders; this generates opportunities for all community members to more broadly access resources and markets to improve adaptive capacity.","[Zeren, Gongbu; Tan, Jing] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qian] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Sociol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Qiuying, Bading] Qinghai Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Xining, Peoples R China; [Zeren, Gongbu] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Chengdu 611100, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Qinghai Normal University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Zeren, GB (corresponding author), Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Chengdu 611100, Peoples R China.",gongbuyak@swufe.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71703126],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China: [Grant Number 71703126].,,61,0,0,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

More spe-cifically, this study investigates how farming households' decisions to adapt to climate change affects agricul-tural productivity in the Batticaloa district of Sri Lanka. The data were collected through a primary survey of 238 farming households. We employ a simultaneous equations model with endogenous switching to investigate the differing effects of adaptation on adapters and non-adapters. The findings show that most farmers perceive there are adverse climate change impacts on their agricultural production. We also find that farmers' adaptation measures substantially boost rice yields. Moreover, it is shown that such strategies would benefit both adapters and non-adapters. Farmers' access to climate related information, education, membership in farmer organiza-tions and size of plots are found to play a key role in the adaptation process. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence of the positive impact of adaptations on food productivity and farm income, thus suggesting the need for policy interventions that enhance farmers uptake of strategies against climate change impacts.","[Suresh, Kanesh; Wilson, Clevo; Quayle, Annette] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Suresh, Kanesh] Eastern Univ, Chenkaladi, Sri Lanka; [Khanal, Uttam] Agr Victoria, Dept Jobs Precincts & Reg, Bundoora, Vic, Australia; [Managi, Shunsuke] Kyushu Univ, Urban Inst, Fukuoka, Japan; [Managi, Shunsuke] Kyushu Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Fukuoka, Japan; [Santhirakumar, Samithamby] South Eastern Univ, Oluvil, Sri Lanka","Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Eastern University, Sri Lanka; Kyushu University; Kyushu University; South Eastern University of Sri Lanka","Managi, S (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Urban Inst, Fukuoka, Japan.;Managi, S (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Fukuoka, Japan.",managi@doc.kyushu-u.ac.jp,"Managi, Shunsuke/G-1740-2013; Quayle, Annette/L-8695-2018","Managi, Shunsuke/0000-0001-7883-1427; kanesh, suresh/0000-0001-5305-3542; Quayle, Annette/0000-0001-8060-3167; Wilson, Clevo/0000-0002-3885-0495",,,,,53,21,21,3,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,OCT,2021,109,,,,,,,,105601,10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105601,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105601,,,9,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WC6XB,,,,,2023-03-25,WOS:000704397800010,View Full Record in Web of Science

We develop the first framework for assessing transboundary adaptive capacity. The framework considers six dimensions of transboundary river basins that influence planning and implementation of adaptation measures and represents those dimensions using twelve measurable indicators. These indicators are used to assess transboundary adaptive capacity of 42 basins in the Middle East, Mediterranean, and Sahel. We then conduct a cluster analysis of those basins to delineate a typology that includes six categories of basins: High Capacity, Mediated Cooperation, Good Neighbour, Dependent Instability, Self-Sufficient, and Low Capacity. We find large variation in adaptive capacity across the study area; basins in Western Europe generally have higher capacities to address the potential hazards of climate change. Our basin typology points to how climate change adaptation policy interventions would be best targeted across the different categories of basins.","[Milman, Anita] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Bunclark, Lisa] Univ Newcastle Univ, Sch Agr Food & Rural Dev, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Conway, Declan] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Adger, William Neil] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of East Anglia; University of Exeter,"Milman, A (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Holdsworth Hall, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",amilman@eco.umass.edu; l.a.bunclark@ncl.ac.uk; d.conway@uea.ac.uk; n.adger@exeter.ac.uk,"Conway, Declan/HCH-7778-2022; McLean, Laurence JA/C-7367-2014; Adger, Neil/F-7676-2010","Adger, Neil/0000-0003-4244-2854; Conway, Declan/0000-0002-4590-6733",European Union Framework 7 Research Programme,European Union Framework 7 Research Programme,"We thank Aaron Wolf and Jennifer Veilleux with the Oregon State Transboundary Freshwater Dispute Database for the GIS files used in this analysis; Itay Fischhendler with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem for data on uncertainty mechanisms and data sharing; and Lucia De Stefano with the Universidad Complutense de Madrid for data on treaty resilience.
