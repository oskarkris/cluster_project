1461,"This article calls for a stronger engagement by geographers with the concept of socionature as a vehicle for guiding adaptation thinking in development planning. Drawing on literatures from poststructuralist geographies, it argues for a relational, hybrid ontology of climate change adaptation grounded in multiple perspectives, knowledges, and more-than-human relations. Going beyond this stance, a framework based on the idea of planning with climate change is proposed for a revised approach to adaptation that calls for more-than-social planning practices embedded in radically more integrative planning processes and the redistribution of power across the climate and planning systems. The article ends by highlighting some of the key challenges that such a project faces for scholars working in the field of planning and development research. Key Words: climate change adaptation, development, human geography, planning, poststructuralist theory."
1815,"Climate change is contributing to the severity and rate of stream degradation by changing the timing of peak flows, altering flow regimes, creating more frequent and intense disturbances, and increasing stream temperatures. Herein we describe three case studies of trout stream adaptation that address existing and climate-driven causes of degradation through habitat restoration. The case studies vary in geography and complexity, but all include restoration efforts intended to address multiple causes of stream degradation and improve the resilience of these streams to floods, droughts, and wildfires. Four elements of successful climate adaptation projects emerge: (1) habitat assessments that help drive project location and design, (2) projects that directly address climate change impacts and increase habitat resilience, (3) projects that combine to achieve watershed-scale impacts, and (4) projects that include sufficient monitoring to determine their effectiveness. We describe solutions to common challenges in conducting climate change adaptation, including how to balance scientific assessments with opportunities when choosing projects, how smaller projects can be aggregated to achieve watershed-scale benefits, and how citizen science efforts can augment monitoring programs."
3055,"The 22nd International Congress on Irrigation and Drainage with the main theme 'Securing Water for Food and Rural Community under Climate Change' was held in September 2014 in Gwangju, Korea. Under this theme, Congress Question 58 'How do Irrigation and Drainage Play an Important Role in Climate Change Adaptation?' was raised. This paper summarizes the discussions and results of 48 papers and 27 posters accepted under this question. This overview confirms the role of irrigation and drainage management as intervention to mitigate the impacts of climate change, and consequent extreme climate events have to be factored into all decision-making processes. It also highlights that particular attention should be paid to the uncertainty in climate change assessment and that the assessment is expected to be more dependable with the development of better analysis methods and a greater availability of reliable climate data and future scenarios. At this stage, it is very hard to do an integrated impact assessment, which covers the whole agricultural and hydrological process, including all scales and aspects such as on-farm to basin, crop growth to farming system, production to environment, etc. Therefore, each sub-process is to be evaluated and accumulation of its outcomes and cases promoted.

4417,"Historically, Latin American social development has been diverse and heterogeneous. It depends on the use of natural resources (with greater or less added value and productive diversity), the influence of social movements, the role of political parties, the level of education, and the prevailing culture. Inequality and social exclusion are still prevalent in most Latin American countries. Poverty and environmental deterioration tend to be correlated. Therefore strategies for mitigation of and adaptation to climate change must consider measures for overcoming poverty and reducing inequality."
4823,The long-standing lack of river basin management policies in Buenos Aires has impacted the development of strategies for facing climate change. This is a highly complex matter in a metropolis that has developed in a context of significant social and environmental inequality. An environmental justice perspective on the institutional changes in the wake of the Supreme Court's rulings in favor of citizens invoking the constitutional right to a healthy environment in the Matanza-Riachuelo Basin illustrates the challenges of environmental management in greater Buenos Aires and the obstacles and opportunities in the development of climate change adaptation policies in the medium term.
5281,"According to dominant narratives about adaptation to climate change, those facing worst-case scenarios, without means at their disposal to adapt in situ, face an ineluctable set of adaptation strategies that ultimately includes the permanent abandonment of geographic spaces rendered uninhabitable and unproductive for human use. Yet environmental stress and adaptive capacity are distributed unevenly, and power structures play a role in fashioning them. It is argued here that when access to land and water are impacted by environmental stress, the structures that mediate their access are reinforced, even as the adaptive alternatives for smallholders are undermined. In this way, dominant resource regimes set up migration as the primary viable alternative for adaptation among a dwindling set of choices. This framework is applied to two early analogues of climate change impacts: flooded Garifuna villages of Honduras's North Coast and communities enduring glacier recession and shifting hydrologic regimes in Peru's Cordillera Blanca. In both cases, stress motivates new forms of migration that reinforce dominant power structures. In Honduras, migrants from wealthier social strata are moving on a more permanent basis, and in Peru, the once historical pattern of labor migration is becoming a practical necessity. These cases underscore the role of political economy in adaptation to climate change and adaptive migration in particular."
6997," A Latourian actor-network analysis of social narratives about climate change in the city of Concepcion and the strategies of collective adaptation to climate change deployed by two social groups shows a difference in people's relationships with nature. The discourses of climate change in the city view it as a backdrop about which not much can be done and hold more powerful others responsible for causing it and for dealing with it. In contrast, in the settlement of Aguita de la Perdiz and among the peasants of the agro-ecological movement in the Bio-Bio Region, climate change is not simply a backdrop but a threat to their quality of life and subsistence, an actant that brings agency to their socio-techno-natural networks, and they have developed measures to control its potential destructive effects."
7890,"Climate change adaptation is an important issue for water and food security but also to sustainable development in the future. How the weather and climate elements will change in the future under climate change conditions will determine the long-term sustainability of water supplies for food production in many areas. Therefore, it is critical to address the issue of climate variability and change on the impacts on water availability. This paper highlights the following topics: latest scientific understanding on climate change; efforts being made by World Meteorological Organization (WMO) through its network of National Hydrological and Meteorological Services in delivering science based services; establishment of the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) which has been established by the WMO in collaboration with other international agencies to provide climate information and services; and need for broader collaboration and cooperation among different development sectors at global as well as regional and national levels. ICID and its members were urged to establish linkages at the global, regional and national levels to ensure that climate information and services reach their audiences for the betterment of humanity. It was stressed that the various ICID and WMO communities can make a difference by working together. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
7899,"We examine collective action in the food system of the Canadian Maritimes to determine its effect on the resilience and adaptive capacity of food producers, distributors, retailers and governance institutions. Our data suggest that beyond their immediate benefits for their participants, expressions of collective action generate higher-level impacts which often translate into drivers of adaptive capacity. Drawing on a metaphor from urban design, we suggest that collective action should be considered a desire line for food systems adaptation: rather than building adaptation strategies based on top-down design, collective action emerges from farmers' needs and capacities to build financial resilience, enhance human and social capital and strengthen institutional agency within the system."
10874,"Defining a reference climate for precipitation is an important requirement in the development of climate change scenarios to support climate adaptation strategies. It is also important for many hydrological and water resource applications. This, however, remains a challenge in regions that are poorly covered by meteorological stations, such as northern Canada or mountainous regions. Reanalyses may represent an interesting option to define a reference climate in such regions. However, these need to be validated and corrected for bias before they can be used. In this paper, two data assimilation methods, Optimal Interpolation (OI) and Ensemble Optimal interpolation (EnOI), were used to combine four reanalysis datasets with observations in order to improve the representation of various precipitation indices across Canada. A total of 986 meteorological stations with minimally 20-year precipitation records over the 30-year reference period (1980-2009) were used. Annual values of ten Climate Precipitations Indices (CPIs) were estimated for each available dataset and were then combined (reanalysis plus observations) using OI and EnOI. A cross-validation strategy was finally applied to assess the relative performance of these datasets. Results suggest that combining reanalysis and observations through OI or EnOI improves CPI estimates at sites where no recorded precipitation is available. The EnOI dataset outperformed OI applied to each reanalysis independently. An evaluation of the gridded interpolated observational dataset from Natural Resources Canada showed it should be used with considerable caution for extreme CPIs because it can underestimate annual maximum 1-day precipitation, as well as overestimate the annual number of wet days."
11078,"The concept of vulnerability as the combination of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to a stressor is gaining traction outside of the climate realm, opening new avenues to address contemporary sustainability issues more holistically. Yet, critical notions that underpin vulnerability have yet to be integrated into its application to natural resource management and non-climatic stressors. In particular, the way generic and stressor-specific facets of vulnerability interact and can inform decision-makers about how interventions combine and/or trade-off remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the salience of the generic/specific framing in the context of Chilean artisanal fishing communities engaged in rights-based co-management and experiencing pressures from two stressors: poaching and market volatility. Specifically, we draw on market data combined with socio-economic surveys conducted with 446 members and leaders from 42 fisher unions to quantitatively investigate potential trade-offs and synergies between facets of vulnerability to poaching and markets. Generic adaptive capacity (i.e. flexibility, assets, learning, organization and agency) likely facilitated stressor-specific adaptive capacities to both stressors. High levels of specific adaptive capacity to one stressor neither increased exposure nor undermined specific adaptive capacity to the other stressor. However, adaptive capacity did not translate into exposure reduction as expected, suggesting that adaptation barriers may prevent fishers from mobilizing adaptive capacity into effective adaptive action. This study illustrates how breaking down vulnerability into generic and specific facets can help us better anticipate important trade-offs and synergies in management interventions. More generally, it highlights the potential of the climate adaptation and vulnerability literatures in informing place-based management of natural resources.
